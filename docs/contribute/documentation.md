# Updating the Developer Guide

The developer guide is created using [MkDocs](http://mkdocs.org){: target="_blank" .external } with the [Materials theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/){: target="_blank" .external } theme.

MkDocs takes Markdown documents and turns them into a static website, that can be accessed from a filesystem or served from a web server.

## Document layout

The documentation is organized into distinct sections to provide easy navigation and allow self-service viewers to get started, then dive into deeper content with a clear path.

The sections are as follows:

1. **Overview** - This is high level information about the Cloud-Native Toolkit.  What it is and why does it exist.
2. **Install** - This is a section designed to help the first time user get up and running with minimal knowledge.  More advanced install options are provided in a later section
3. **Learning** - This section is designed to teach the fundamentals of Cloud-Native development with the toolkit.  Using a default installation of the Toolkit to work through Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery.  This section is more about Cloud-Native development and how the Toolkit provides functionality to support Cloud-Natove development rather than a deep dive on specific tools that are part of the toolkit.
4. **Adopting** - This section is designed to move from the initial learning phase to adopting the Toolkit as part of development activities.  It covers more advanced installation options, customization options, best practices and how the Toolkit can be applied to certain use cases
5. **Reference** - The reference section is the technical documentation for the resources delivered by the Toolkit.
6. **Resources** - The resources section provides links to content outside the toolkit that someone learning the toolkit may find usefu
7. **Contributing** - This section provides how someone can become a contributor to the Cloud-Native Toolkit project, which includes the core Toolkit, adding additional starter kits or pipeline tasks, updating or adding to the documentation.  

## Creating content

MkDocs supports standard Markdown syntax and a set Markdown extensions provided by plugins.  The exact Markdown syntax supported is based on the [python implementation](https://python-markdown.github.io).

MkDocs is configured using the **mkdocs.yml** file in the root of the git repository.  For the prototype, the existing Gatsby content is still within the repository, with the prototype content located in the **mkdocs** directory.

The **mkdoc.yml** file defines the top level navigation for the site.  The level of indentation is configurable (this requires the theme to support this feature) with Markdown headings, levels 2 (`##`) and 3 (`###`) being used for the page navigation on the right of the page.

### Standard Markdown features

The following markdown syntax is used within the documentation

!!!Todo
    Complete the table below

| Syntax | Result
|--------|-----------
|`# Title` | a level 1 heading containing.  You can create up to 6 levels of headings by adding additiona; `#` characters, so `###` is a level 3 heading
|`**text**` | will display the word ```text``` in **bold**
|`*text*` | will display the word ```text``` in *italic*

HTML can be embedded in Markdown, but in the documentation it is preferred to stick with pure Markdown with the installed extensions.

### Links within MkDocs generated content

MkDocs will warn of any internal broken links, so it is important that links within the documentation are recognised as internal links.  

- a link starting with a protocol name, such as http or https, is an external link
- a link starting with `/` is an external link.  This is because MkDocs generated content can be embedded into another web application, so links can point outside of the MkDocs generated site but hosted on the same website
- a link starting with a file name (including the .md extension) or relative directory (../directory/filename.md) is an internal link and will be verified by MkDocs

!!!Information
    Internal links should be to the Markdown file.  When the site is generated the filename will be automatically converted to the correct URL

## Extensions used in the prototype

There are a number of Markdown extensions being used in the prototype.  See the mkdocs.yml file to see which extensions are configured.  The documentation for the extensions can be found [here](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/)

### Link configuration

Links on the page or embedded images can be annotated to control the links and also the appearance of the links:

#### Image

Images are embedded in a page using the standard Markdown syntax `![description](URL)`, but the image can be formatted with [Attribute Lists](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/attr_list/){: target="_blank" .external }.  This is most commonly used to scale an image or center an image, e.g.

```md
![GitHub repo url](images/github-repo-url.png){style="width: 80%" .center }
```

#### External Links

External links can also use attribute lists to control behaviours, such as open in new tab or add a css class attribute to the generated HTML, such as **external** in the example below:

```md
[MkDocs](http://mkdocs.org){: target="_blank" .external }
```

#### YouTube videos

It is not possible to embed a YouTube video and have it play in place using pure markdown.  You can use HTML to embed a video:

```html
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u3PTRqkd94k" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

but you can use a link that will open the video in a new browser tab using pure markdown:

```markdown
[![alt-content](img URL)](video URL "video title"){: target="_blank"}
```

where:

- alt-content is the content used if the image cannot be displayed by the browser
- img URL is the URL for the thumbnail image for the video.  For YouTube this is usually `http://img.youtube.com/vi/<video ID>/0.jpg`
- video URL is the URL used to launch the video in a new tab (this can be found by opening the video on YouTube and capturing the URL from the browser address bar - this also provides the video ID to be used in the image). It typically looks like `https://youtu.be/u3PTRqkd94k` or `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3PTRqkd94k`
- video title is a string that is displayed to the viewer when they hover over the video image

!!!info
    You can also use the same technique to create clickable images that launch to another site: `[![Image description](Image URL)](target URL "hover text"){: target=_blank}`

### Tabs

Content can be organised into a set of horizontal tabs.  

```md
=== "Tab 1"
    Hello

=== "Tab 2"
    World
```

produces :

=== "Tab 1"
    Hello

=== "Tab 2"
    World

### Information boxes

The [Admonition](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/admonition/){: target="_blank" .external } extension allows you to add themed information boxes using the `!!!` and `???` syntax:

```md
!!! note
    This is a note
```

produces:

!!! note
    This is a note

and

```text
??? note
    This is a note

    You can add a `+` character to force the box to be initially open `???+`
```

produces a collapsible box:

??? note
    This is a collapsible note

    You can add a `+` character to force the box to be initially open `???+`

You can override the title of the box by providing a title after the Admonition type.  

!!!Example
    You can also nest different components as required

    === "note"
        !!!note
            This is a note

    === "collapsible note"
        ???+note
            This is a note

    === "custom title note"
        !!!note "Sample Title"
            This is a note

    === "Markdown"
        ```md
        !!!Example
            You can also nest different components as required

            === "note"
                !!!note
                    This is a note

            === "collapsible note"
                ???+note
                    This is a note

            === "custom title note"
                !!!note "Sample Title"
                    This is a note
        ```

## Setting up an documentation environment

To work on documentation and be able to view the rendered web site you need to create an environment, which comprises of:

- Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org) on your system
- Clone or Fork the documentation repository
- cd into the documentation directory
- Install the required python packages `pip install -r requirements.txt'

You now have all the tools installed to be able to create the static HTML site from the markdown documents.  The [documentation for MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) provides full instructions for using MkDocs, but the important commands are:

- `mkdocs build` will build the static site.  This must be run in the root directory of the repo, where mkdocs.yml is located
- `mkdocs serve` will build the static site and launch a test server on http://localhost:8000.  Everytime a document is modified the website will automatically be updated and any browser open will be refreshed to the latest.

!!!Warning
    Within the configuration mkdocs is configured to fail with internal broken links.  This will also kill the local test server.  If you want to disable this functionality change the **strict** value in mkdocs.yml from `strict: true` to `strict: false`.  Do not check in mkdocs.yaml with strict disabled, as we don't want to publish broken documentation!
