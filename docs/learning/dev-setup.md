# Cloud-Native Toolkit Developer Setup

!!!ToDo
    This will be the setup needed for a developer to run through the learning content  
    - Prerequisites  
    - Install required CLI tools  
    - Git setup (Personal Access Token)

!!!Todo
    Should we offer different experiences?  
    - Local laptop  
    - LMS system (no local tooling/setup required)  
    - Hosted Shell in web browser (no local tooling/setup required)

!!!Todo
    Should we create the ArgoCD GitOps repo as part of developer setup - this way the gitops stage in the pipeline will run automatically - saving an additional run after configuration in the Continuous Delivery stage?

    Is creating the CD gitops repo considered a developer setup activity - or should it be within the CD section?
