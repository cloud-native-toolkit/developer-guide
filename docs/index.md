    Very IBM focussed - is this OK or do we want to be more multi-cloud friendly?

The Cloud-Native Toolkit is an open-source collection of assets that enable application development and support teams to deliver business value quickly using Red Hat OpenShift or IBM Cloud-managed Kubernetes. This guide provides information to help Developers, Administrators, and Site Reliability Engineers use the Toolkit to support delivering business applications through the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

The Cloud-Native Toolkit environment has been built to support the principles of a robust SDLC while being flexible enough to fit into a wide range of development settings and toolchains. The Cloud-Native Toolkit supports different tool selections, from open source versions of tools like Artifactory and SonarQube to enterprise-class software like IBM Cloud Pak for Applications and IBM Multicloud Manager.
