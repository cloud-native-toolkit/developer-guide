Initially the Fast-start installation method is the recommended way to install the Cloud-Native Toolkit, as this is largely an automatic install with minimal choices required and creates a default configuration suitable for learning about cloud native development.

When you want to adopt cloud native development within an enterprise development team, then you may want more control over the installation and configuration of the toolkit.  This section outlines more advanced options available for installing the toolkit.

- IBM Cloud Private Catalog:  This provides an easy mechanism to easily create and delete instances of the Cloud-Native Toolkit on OpenShift clusters within the IBM Cloud.
- Iteration-Zero: This gives you full control over customizing how the toolkit is installed and what components you want deployed as part of the toolkit
