# Installing the Cloud-Native Toolkit

!!!note
    If you are a developer attending a training event, where the training environment is provided, you should skip this section and move onto the Cloud-Native Toolkit fast [start content](../learning/fast-start.md)

There is no single way to setup an enterprise development infrastructure for cloud native application development.  There are [many different tools available](https://www.cncf.io/projects/) to help create Cloud Native applications.  You need to find the set of tools and processes to support the needs of the developers and how they work.  This can be a time consuming processes, to evaluate available tools and determine how to integrate them into a development environment.

The Cloud-Native toolkit is an opinionated set of tools to create a production ready development environment.  The toolkit also provides installation options and starter kits to get you up and running quickly.

If you don't have access to a Cloud-Native Toolkit then you need to select one of the setup options to install the toolkit before moving onto the learning.

## Options for installing the toolkit

!!!Todo
    Add a graphic here to summarise the different install options (with indications of when an approach is appropriate)

The Cloud-Native toolkit will run on a standard Kubernetes cluster or on the Red Hat OpenShift hybrid cloud platform, which is based on Kubernetes.

The Cloud-Native toolkit supports many different options for installing and configuring the toolkit across a number of different Kubernetes based environment, but for the first install it is recommended to follow the fast-start setup.  

The [fast-start installation](fast-start.md) will create an environment for you to learn about cloud native development.  Once you have a better understanding of cloud native development you can then make informed decisions about how you want to do Cloud-Native Development within your production environment and customize the toolkit to meet your requirements.

You will find additional installation and toolkit configuration options in the [Adopting the toolkit](../adopting/setup/installing.md) section, but the recommended path for your first installation is the [fast-start installation](fast-start.md) option.
