Use Tekton to automate your continuous integration process

</PageDescription>

## Overview

Continuous integration is a software development technique where software is built regularly by a team in an automated fashion.

Tekton is a new emerging CI tool that has been built to support Kubernetes and OpenShift from the ground up.

## What is Tekton

[Tekton](https://tekton.dev/) is a powerful yet flexible Kubernetes-native open-source framework for creating continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) systems. It lets you build, test, and deploy across multiple cloud providers or on-premises systems by abstracting away the underlying implementation details.

### Tekton 101

Tekton provides open-source components to help you standardize your CI/CD tooling and processes across vendors, languages, and deployment environments. Industry specifications around pipelines, releases, workflows, and other CI/CD components available with Tekton will work well with existing CI/CD tools such as Jenkins, Jenkins X, Skaffold, and Knative, among others.

- Read the this this [Overview of Tekton](/guides/continuous-integration-tekton-crc#what-is-tekton)

- For more information read up about it [Tekton Tutorial](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/knative-build-app-development-with-tekton/)

- For more information read up about it [App Build Tutorial with Tekton](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/knative-build-app-development-with-tekton/)

The IBM Cloud is standardizing on using Tekton in both IBM Cloud DevOps
 service and IBM Cloud Pak for Applications. OpenShift 4.2 will also natively
  support it.

This guide will focus on using Tekton when the Development tools have been
 installed in Redhat OpenShift, IBM Kubernetes Managed services and **Red Hat
  Code Ready Containers** to give you choice for you Continuous Integration
   cloud native development toolset.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** This guide will help you set up the [<Globals name="templates" />](/codepatterns/overview) with  **Tekton** and requires that you have installed Tekton with **Red Hat Code Ready Containers 4.2** or have installed open source Tekton into the The IBM Kubernetes Cluster.

### Common App Tasks

The following gives a description of each `Task` that is commonly used in a
 `Pipeline`. The *Optional* stages can be deleted or ignored if the tool support it is not installed. These stages represent a typical production pipeline flow for a Cloud Native application.

- **Setup** clones the code into the pipeline
- **Build** runs the build commands for the code
- **Test**	validates the unit tests for the code
- **Publish pacts**	(*optional*) publishes any pact contracts that have been defined
- **Verify pact** (*optional*) verifies the pact contracts
- **Sonar scan** (*optional*) runs a sonar code scan of the source code and publishes the results to SonarQube
- **Build image** Builds the code into a Docker images and stores it in the IBM Cloud Image registry
- **Deploy to DEV env**	Deploys the Docker image tagged version to `dev` namespace using Helm Chart
- **Health Check** Validates the Health Endpoint of the deployed application
- **Package Helm Chart** (*optional*) Stores the tagged version of the Helm chart into Artifactory
- **Trigger CD Pipeline** (*optional*) This is a GitOps stage that will
 update the build number in designated git repo and trigger ArgoCD for
  deployment to **test** namespace

### Install Tekton

Tekton can be installed in both RedHat Openshift and IBM Kubernetes manage
 service and RedHat Code Ready Containers. To install the necessary
  components follow the steps below.
  
- Install [IBM Garage for Cloud Developer Tools](/admin/overview) on your
 managed OpenShift,CRC or IKS development cluster on the IBM Cloud. This will
  help configure the tools and `secrets` and `configMap` to make working with

      apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
      kind: Ingress
      metadata:
        name: tekton-dashboard
        namespace: tekton-pipelines
      spec:
        rules:
        - host: tekton-dashboard.showcase-dev-iks-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud
          http:
            paths:
            - backend:
                serviceName: tekton-dashboard
                servicePort: 9097
    ```
- Install [Tekton Webhook Extension](https://github.com/tektoncd/experimental/tree/master/webhooks-extension#install-webhook-extension) 

</Tab>

</Tabs> 

### Setup Tekton

- Install Tekton pipelines and tasks into the `dev` namespace following the
 instructions in the repository [ibm-garage-tekton-tasks](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-tekton-tasks/blob/master/README.md)
- Install the `Tasks`
    ```bash
    kubectl create -f ibm-garage-tekton-tasks/tasks/ -n dev
    ```
- Install the `Pipelines`
    ```bash
    kubectl create -f ibm-garage-tekton-tasks/pipelines/ -n dev  
    ```
  
### Configure namespace for development

- Install the Tekton CLI `tkn` https://github.com/tektoncd/cli

- Create a new namespace (ie `dev-{initials}`) and copy all config and secrets
  ```
  igc namespace -n {new-namespace}
  ```
- Set your `new-namespace` the current namespace context
  ```
  oc project {new-namespace}
  ```

- The template `Pipelines` provided support for `Java` or `Node.js` based apps. You can configure your own custom `Tasks` for other runtimes. There are a number of default `Tasks` to get you started they are detailed above. To create an application use one of the provided [<Globals name="templates" />](/codepatterns/overview) these templates work seamlessly with the `Tasks` and `Pipelines` provided.

### Register the App with Tekton

With Tetkon enabled and your default `Tasks` and `Pipelines` installed into
 the `dev` namespace. You can now configure your applications to be built, packaged, tested and deployed to your OpenShift or Kubernetes development cluster.

<Tab label="IGC Steps">

One of the objectives of the **IBM Garage for Cloud Developer tools CLI** is to
 remove complexity from the steps of configuring apps with OpenShift and
  Kubernetes managed service. 
<br></br>  

The `IBM Garage CLI` has been created to automate manual steps where it is
 deemed necessary. When it comes to configuring **Tekton** there are a number
  of key steps that developers can performing manually,  often with complex
   manual steps the developer can introduce errors causing mistakes that are
    hard to debug. This
    is a perfect problem to be solved with simple automation.
<br></br>

If you are happy to perform the manual steps switch over to the **Manual
 Steps** tab above to understand what is required to configure a **Tekton** Pipeline in Openshift or Kubernetes managed services manually.
<br></br>      

- The CLI has support for **Tekton** by adding a `--tekton` parameter to
 the `igc
 pipeline` command.    
    ```bash
    igc pipeline -n dev-{initials} --tekton
    ```

- This will prepare the namespace/project with the necessary `Tasks`, `Pipelines`, `Secrets` and `configMaps` needed for the `Pipelines` to
 execute inside the Tekton CI environment.  
    ```bash
    Getting git parameters
      Project git repo: https://github.com/mooc-team-one/hello-world-one.git
    ? Provide the username: {git userid}
    ? Provide your password/personal access token: [hidden]
    ? Provide the branch the pipeline should use: master
    Setting up dev-mjp namespace
    Checking for existing namespace: dev-mjp
    Setting up pull secrets
    Setting up tls secrets
    Adding pull secrets to serviceAccount
    Copying ConfigMaps
    Copying Secrets
    Copying Tekton tasks
    Copying Tekton pipelines
    Copying Jenkins credentials
    Creating service account: pipeline
    Creating Git PipelineResource
    Creating Image PipelineResource
    ? Select the Pipeline to use in the PipelineRun: igc-nodejs
    Creating PipelineRun for pipeline: igc-nodejs
    ```

- Once the App has been configured to be built and managed by **Tekton** you
 can now view the `Pipeline` progress using the various Tekton Dashboards or
  `tkn` CLI. 


</Tab>

<Tab label="Manual Steps">

The following is the list of steps required to manually configure a **Tekton
** pipeline with your development cluster.
<br></br>


- Configure the service account `pipeline` if it doesn't exist, on OpenShift 4 the operator takes care of this you can skip.
  ```
  oc create serviceaccount pipeline
  oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z pipeline
  oc adm policy add-role-to-user edit -z pipeline
  ```
- Clone the tasks from the `tools` namespace into the `new-namespace`
  ```
  kubectl get tasks --export -o yaml -n tools  | sed s/"namespace: tools/namespace: $(oc project -q)"/ | kubectl apply -f -
  ```
- Clone the pipelines from the `tools` namespace into the `new-namespace`
  ```
  kubectl get pipelines --export -o yaml -n tools  | sed s/"namespace: tools/namespace: $(oc project -q)"/ | kubectl apply -f -
  ```

### Manually trigger a Pipeline

### Pipeline Resource

- Create a Pipeline resource for the git repository, replace with the correct github url for your repository
  Use the `tkn` CLI to create `git` resource input the github repo url for `url` and branch for `revision`
  ```
  tkn resource create
  ```
  Here is the an example of the cli 
  ```
  tkn resource create       
  ? Enter a name for a pipeline resource : nodejs-typescript-git
  ? Select a resource type to create : git
  ? Enter a value for url :  https://github.com/{user or org}/{app}
  ? Enter a value for revision :  master
  New git resource "nodejs-typescript-git" has been created
  ```
- Create a Pipeline resource for the docker image registry, you can use the internal registry in OpenShift or use an external registry like IBM Container Registry (credentials need setup)
  Use the `tkn` CLI to create `image` resource
  ```
  tkn resource create
  ```
  Select `image` for type.
  
  Enter the corresponding `url` for container registry, use the new-namespace} in the url 
  
  For OCP 3 internal registry use `docker-registry.default.svc:5000/{new-namespace}/node-typescript:latest`
  
  For OCP 4 or CRC internal registry use `image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/{new-namespace}/node-typescript:latest`
  
  For external registry like IBM Container registry based on region use `us.icr.io/{namespace}/node-typescript:latest` use an existing namespace in your IBM Cloud
  ```
  tkn resource create
  ? Enter a name for a pipeline resource : nodejs-typescript-image
  ? Select a resource type to create : image
  ? Enter a value for url :  docker-registry.default.svc:5000/dev/node-typescript:latest
  ? Enter a value for digest :  
  New image resource "nodejs-typescript-image" has been created
  ```
- Select the pipeline, to show the available pipeline run
  ```
  tkn pipeline ls                                         
  NAME              AGE              LAST RUN   STARTED   DURATION   STATUS
  igc-java-gradle   33 minutes ago   ---        ---       ---        ---
  igc-nodejs        33 minutes ago   ---        ---       ---        ---
  ```
  In this case use `igc-java-gradle` for java or `igc-nodejs` for nodejs.
- Run the Pipeline using the `git` and `image` Pipeline resources.
  Set the following environment variable for convienience:
  ```
  export PIPELINE=igc-nodejs
  export GIT=nodejs-typescript-git
  export IMAGE=nodejs-typescript-image
  ```
  Then run the `tkn pipeline start` with the input arguments using the service account `pipeline`
  ```
  tkn pipeline start \
  ${PIPELINE} \
  -r git-source=${GIT} \
  -r docker-image=${IMAGE} \
  -s pipeline
  ```

### Create a Git Webhook 

- Open the Tekton Dashboard from the main Tools Dashboard or the ICPA landing page.

- Create a Webhook in the Tekton Dashboard
    ![Webhook](/images/webhook.png)

    - Click **Webhook** on the menu
    - Click **Add Webhook** and enter the information for the webhook
    - Name: **insert name**
    - Repository UR: **template git repo url**
    - Access Token: Create github access token with permission minimum write:repo_hook
    - Namespace: **insert namespace**
    - Pipeline: select **igc-java-gradle** or **igc-nodejs**
    - Service Account: **pipeline**
    - Docker Registry:
        - For OCP 3 internal registry use `docker-registry.default.svc:5000/{new-namespace}`
        - For OCP 4 or CRC internal registry use `image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/{new-namespace}`
        - For external registry like IBM Container registry based on region use `us.icr.io/{namespace}` use an existing namespace in your IBM Cloud. Make sure to configure docker credentials in the Tekton Dashboard using your IAM API Key and `iamapikey` for username in your namespace.

- Check that Webhook is created on the Github repository (Settings-Webhooks)

- Make a change to the git repo and push the change to remote git repository or click on **Pipelines**
and manually kick of a pipeline build

    ```bash
    tkn pipelinerun describe {pipeline-name}              
    ```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Running Application

Once the **Tekton** pipeline has successfully completed you can validate your
 app has been successfully deployed.

- Open the OpenShift Console and select the {new-namespace} project and click on **Workloads**
    ![OpenShift](/images/openshiftconsole.png)

- Get the hostname for the application from ingress
    ```bash
    kubectl get ingress --all-namespace
    ```
- You can use the the `igc` command to get the name of the deployed application
    ```bash
    igc ingress -n {new-namespace}
    ```

- Use the application URL to open it your browser for testing
