Use GitOps to continuously deliver application changes

</PageDescription>

[Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/) is a declarative, [GitOps](/getting-started-day-0/git-ops) [continuous delivery](/getting-started-day-2/continuous-delivery) 
tool for Kubernetes. The deployment environment is a namespace in a container platform like <Globals name="kube" /> or <Globals name="ocp" />. 
Argo CD models a collection of applications as a project and uses a Git repository to store the application's desired state. 
Argo CD is flexible in the structure of the application configuration represented in the Git repository.

Argo CD supports defining Kubernetes manifests in a number of ways:
- helm charts
- kustomize
- ksonnet
- jsonnet
- plain directory of yaml/json manifests
- custom plugins

Argo CD compares the actual state of the application in the cluster with the desired state defined in Git and determines if
they are out of sync. When it detects the environment is out of sync, Argo CD can be configured to either send out a 
notification to kick off a separate reconciliation process or Argo CD can automatically synchronize the environments to 
ensure they match. 

## Configuring GitOps with Argo CD

**Terminology:**

Argo CD uses a number of terms to refer to the components

- Application - A deployable unit

    In the context of the <Globals name="env" />, an application is one Helm chart that contains one container image 
    that was produced by one CI pipeline. While Helm charts and images could certainly be combined to make more 
    sophisticated applications in more advanced scenarios, we will be using this simple definition here.
    
- Project - A collection of applications that make up a solution

### Set up the GitOps repo

Argo CD uses a Git repo to express the desired state of the Kubernetes environment. The basic setup uses one 
repository to represent one [*project*](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/projects/). Within that 
repository, each [*application*](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#applications) 
that makes up the project will be described in its own folder. The repository will also contain a branch for each 
destination (i.e. cluster and namespace) into which we want to deploy the applications.

**Note:** There is nothing special about a git repository used for git-ops. All that is required at a minimum is a hosted git
repository that is accessible from by the Argo CD instance.  The [Argo CD <Globals name="template" />](https://github.com/IBM/template-argocd-gitops/generate) 
used in the following steps is optional and provides some application templates to help simplify some configuration activities.

</InlineNotification>

1. Create a new repo from the [Argo CD <Globals name="template" />](https://github.com/IBM/template-argocd-gitops/generate)

1. Clone the project to your machine

1. Create a branch for the environment (e.g. `test` to configure the values for deployment to the testing environment)

    ```shell script
    git checkout -b test
    ```

1. Push the test branch up to the repository

    ```shell script
    git push -u origin test
    ```

### Hook the CI pipeline to the CD pipeline

The last stage in the CI pipeline updates a GitOps repository with the updated application metadata from the build. In
order to do that, the CI pipeline needs to know which repository should be used and needs the credentials to push changes
to that repository. As with other configuration within the pipeline, this is handled with config maps and secrets:

- A secret named `git-credentials` holds the credentials the CI pipeline uses to access all the respositories in the Git host (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc).
If you used the [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli) to register the pipeline then this secret has already been created.
- A secret named `gitops-repo` holds the url and branch for the gitops repository.

Fortunately the [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli) provides a `gitops` command to simplify this step. Information on how to use the
command as well as the alternative manual steps can be found in the [IGC CLI gitops command](/getting-started/cli#gitops) section.

1. Run the `gitops` command to create the config map and secret in the CI namespace

    ```shell script
    igc gitops
    ```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:**

- For the secret to be available to the CI pipeline, the secret needs to be created in the same namespace where the 
pipeline is running.
- The value provided for `branch` is the one the pipeline will use to when committing changes to trigger the CD 
pipeline.

### Create a project in Argo CD (Optional)

In Argo CD terms, each deployable component is an application and applications are grouped into projects. Projects are not
required for Argo CD to be able to deploy applications, but it helps to organize applications and provide some restrictions
on what can be done for applications that make up a project.

To create a project:

1. Log into the Argo CD user interface

1. Click on the gear icon on the left menu to access the Settings options

    ![Argo CD config](/images/argocd-config.png)

1. Select the Projects option

1. Press the New Project button at the top of the page

1. Specify the properties for the new project

    - Name - Provide the name for the project
    - Description - A brief description of the project
    - Source - Press Add source and pick the Git repository from the list that was added previously
    - Destinations
        - Add `https://kubernetes.default.svc` for the cluster url and `test` for the namespace
        - Add `https://kubernetes.default.svc` for the cluster url and `staging` for the namespace
    - Press Create

    **Note:** Initially, the only cluster that is available is the one in which Argo CD is -
    `https://kubernetes.default.svc`. By adding the two destinations we have allowed the project to be deployed
    to both the `test` and `staging` namespaces within the current cluster.

### Add an application in Argo CD for each application component

The last step in the process is to define the application(s) within Argo CD that should be managed. This consists of
connecting the config within the Git repo to the cluster and namespace.

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Argo CD UI">

1. Log into Argo CD user interface

1. Press `New Application` and provide the following values:

    - `application name` - The name of the application. It is recommend to use the format of `{namespace}-{image name}`
    - `project` - The project with which the application should be included
    - `sync-policy` - The manner with which Argo CD will use to manage the deployed artifacts. `Automatic` is
    recommended
    - `repository url` - The Git url where the configuration is stored
    - `revision` - The branch where the configuration for this instance is stored
    - `path` - The path within the repository where the application config is located (should be the application name)
    - `destination cluster` - The cluster url for the deployment
    - `destination namespace` - The namespace where the application should be deployed

1. Repeat that step for each application and each environment
