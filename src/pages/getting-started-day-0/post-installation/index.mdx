## Explore the provisioned resources

### <Globals name="ic" /> resources

Once the Terraform scripts have finished, you can see the resources that the scripts created in IBM Cloud:

1. In the IBM Cloud console, open the [Resource List](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources "Resource list")
2. On the Resource List page, filter by your Resource Group by selecting the resource group from the `Group` dropdown (e.g. `appdev-team`)
3. You should see these resources listed under the following sections:
    - **Clusters**: 1, either Kubernetes or OpenShift
    - **Services**: depending on the configuration could be quite a few (LogDNA, Sysdig, Activity Tracker, Watson Assistant, Watson Studio, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc)
    - **Storage**: possibly Cloud Object Storage

### Cluster resources

Log in to the cluster and look at the console to see the resources that have been provisioned within the cluster.

1. Access the cluster console

    <Tabs>
    <Tab label="Hybrid">
    
    ```shell script
    oc login {server_url} -u {username} -p {password}
    oc console
    ```
   
    </Tab>
    <Tab label="IBM Cloud">

    - In the IBM Cloud console, open the [Resource List](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources "Resource list")
    - On the Resource List page, filter by your Resource Group by selecting the resource group from the `Group` dropdown (e.g. `appdev-team`)
    - Expand the **Clusters** section and click on the appropriate cluster
    - Click the button to open the Kubernetes or OpenShift web console
    
    </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    
2. Navigate to the `tools` namespace/project.
3. Look at the status of the pods in the cluster. All should be either in `running` or `completed` state.
4. If LogDNA or Sysdig were bound to the cluster then a `ibm-observe` namespace/project should have been created containing
a pod for each node in the cluster

## Verify the environment

The best way to verify that the tools have been configured properly is to deploy a sample pipeline. Follow the 
[deploy an app](/getting-started-day-1/deploy-app) steps for one of the starter kits to ensure that all the tools have 
been configured properly.
