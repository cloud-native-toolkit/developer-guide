Provides a walk-through of the provisioned environment and the steps to validate it is ready to
begin on-boarding developers. 

</PageDescription>

## Explore the provisioned resources

### <Globals name="ic" /> resources

Once the Terraform scripts have finished, you can see the resources that the scripts created in IBM Cloud:

1. In the IBM Cloud console, open the [Resource List](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources "Resource list")
2. On the Resource List page, filter by your Resource Group by selecting the resource group from the `Group` dropdown (e.g. `appdev-team`)
3. You should see these resources listed under the following sections:
    - **Clusters**: 1, either Kubernetes or OpenShift
    - **Services**: depending on the configuration could be quite a few (LogDNA, Sysdig, Activity Tracker, Watson Assistant, Watson Studio, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc)
    - **Storage**: possibly Cloud Object Storage

### Cluster resources

Log in to the cluster and look at the console to see the resources that have been provisioned within the cluster.

1. Access the cluster console

    <Tabs>
    <Tab label="Hybrid">
    
    ```shell script
    oc login {server_url} -u {username} -p {password}
    oc console
    ```
   
    </Tab>
    <Tab label="IBM Cloud">

    - In the IBM Cloud console, open the [Resource List](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources "Resource list")
    - On the Resource List page, filter by your Resource Group by selecting the resource group from the `Group` dropdown (e.g. `appdev-team`)
    - Expand the **Clusters** section and click on the appropriate cluster
    - Click the button to open the Kubernetes or OpenShift web console
    
    </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    
2. Navigate to the `tools` namespace/project.
3. Look at the status of the pods in the cluster. All should be either in `running` or `completed` state.
4. If LogDNA or Sysdig were bound to the cluster then a `ibm-observe` namespace/project should have been created containing
a pod for each node in the cluster

### Validate LogDNA

If LogDNA was provisioned and/or bound to the cluster, check that log data is flowing into [LogDNA](/tools/log-management)

### Validate/complete the SysDig setup

Complete the [setup of Sysdig](/admin/sysdig-setup) and [check the monitoring data](/tools/monitoring) is flowing

### Validate the Developer Dashboard
 
Test opening the [<Globals name="dashboard" />](/getting-started/dashboard)

1. Log into the cluster from the command-line
2. Run either or all of the CLI options to load the dashboard 

    <Tabs>
    <Tab label="oc">
    
    ```shell script
    oc dashboard
    ```
   
    </Tab>
    <Tab label="kubectl">
    
    ```shell script
    kubetl dashboard
    ```
   
    </Tab>
    <Tab label="IGC">
    
    ```shell script
    igc dashboard
    ```
   
    </Tab>
    </Tabs>

### Validate the installed tools

1. Log into the cluster from the command-line
2. Run the [<Globals name="igccli" />](/getting-started/cli) `credentials` command to list the credentials for the tools
    ```shell script
    igc credentials -n tools
    ```
3. Use the url and credentials provided for each tool to validate the provided credentials

## Additional configuration

The following post installation setup is required. To get the developers enabled quickly, make sure you have 
completed at least post installation tasks. The customization is optional and down to development team needs.

### Customize the Dashboard configuration
 
Perform the steps in [Configure Dashboard](/admin/config-dashboard) to customize tiles and menu items for the tools
that are external to the cluster.

### Set up user access

Configure the RBAC rules in the development cluster. This restricts who can change the parts of the cluster where 
the tools are installed. 

1. Run the RBAC script `./terraform/scripts/rbac.sh` found in the `ibm-garage-iteration-zero` repository

### Create a CI namespace/project

1. Log into the cluster from the command-line
2. Run the [<Globals name="igccli" />](/getting-started/cli) `sync` command to create the namespace/project
    ```shell script
    igc sync --dev {project}
    ```

### Setup a GitOps repo

1. Follow the steps to [create a GitOps repo](/tools/continuous-delivery#set-up-the-gitops-repo).
2. Follow the steps to [add configuration for the CI pipeline](/tools/continuous-delivery#hook-the-ci-pipeline-to-the-cd-pipeline), using
the namespace created in the [previous step](#create-a-ci-namespaceproject).

### Test the pipeline

The best way to verify that the tools have been configured properly is to deploy a sample pipeline. Follow the 
[deploy an app](/getting-started-day-1/deploy-app) steps for one of the starter kits to ensure that all the tools have 
been configured properly. 

**Note:** Use the project/namespace created in the [previous two steps](#create-a-ci-namespaceproject) when deploying the app
