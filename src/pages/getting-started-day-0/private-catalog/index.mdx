title: Private Catalog

Private catalogs provide a way to centrally manage access to products in the IBM CloudÂ® catalog and your own catalogs. 
You can customize your private catalogs to make specific solutions available to users in your account. By doing so, you 
can ensure that your catalogs are relevant to your business.

Let's say you're an operations admin for your team, and you require access to all products in the IBM Cloud catalog. A
member of your team is tasked with a specific project, for example, building a voice-enabled chatbot by using Watson 
Assistant, Speech to Text, and Text to Speech. And, you want them to access only those products in the IBM Cloud catalog.

To achieve this, you create one catalog that includes all products in the IBM Cloud catalog. Then, you create another 
catalog that includes only the required products, and you give the team member viewer access to the catalog.

Additionally, custom software can be added to the private catalog and easily installed through the tile.
