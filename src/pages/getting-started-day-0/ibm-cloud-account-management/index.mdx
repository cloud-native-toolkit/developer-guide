The <Globals name="ic" /> environment is provided with a number of powerful tools to manage user access and resource provisioning
but little is configured for you out of the box. This guide gives an approach to managing the account in a sensible way that can
easily be extended or re-configured based upon the requirements of a given situation. 

This approach to managing the account is organized around four key roles:

- **Account owner(s)**
- **Account managers**
- **Environment administrators**
- **Environment users**

This diagram from [Resource Access Management](/toolkit-resources/resource-mgmt#access-group-example) 
shows the relationship of these access groups to a pair of development environments:

![Access groups example](../../images/access-example.png)

### Account owner(s)

The `account owner(s)` is the user who owns the account or users who have been granted super-user access to the account
at the same level as the account owner.

An account owner must create the access group for account managers. The account owner will:

- Create an `ACCT-MGR-IAM-ADMIN` access group using the `acp-mgr` script
- Add a functional ID, configured using the `acp-iaas` script, with API keys for the account managers

### Account managers

The `account managers` are an account owner or other users with [account management permissions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-account-services)

As described in [Configure Account](/admin/config-account), the account managers can set up the resource groups 
and access groups needed to install and use the environments. For each environment, the account managers will:
- Create a resource group
- Create an access group named `<resource_group>-ADMIN` using the script `acp-admin`
- Create an access group named `<resource_group>-USER` using the script `acp-user`

### Environment administrators

The `environment administrators` are users in the account 
with [permissions to create services in the environment's resource group](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-userroles#platformroles). In
this case, the "environment" is scoped to the `resource group`. Environment administrators are granted broad access
to create, manage, and destroy services and resources within a given `resource group`.

### Environment users

The `environment users` are users in the account with [permissions to use existing services in the environment's resource group](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-userroles#service_access_roles) 
(e.g. developers, data scientists, etc.). They are consumers of the services and resources that have been provisioned in
order to build and deploy business applications.

## Architecture

The [Environment Architecture](/arch/environment) page shows the structure of the environment that will be installed. Depending upon
the approach for development teams, each [development team](/arch/teams) can be assigned its own (small) environment or
multiple teams can share a single environment. The environment structure is designed to support best practices for 
a [cloud-native application architecture](/arch/application), including designing applications that 
are [built to manage](/arch/manageable).
