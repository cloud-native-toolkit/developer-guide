Steps to prepare an environment using the <Globals name="shortName" /> in an existing OpenShift cluster.

</PageDescription>

### A. Download the Iteration Zero scripts

1. Clone the [ibm-garage-iteration-zero](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-iteration-zero) Git repository to your local filesystem
    ```shell script
    git clone git@github.com:ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-iteration-zero.git
    ```

### B. Configure the credentials

1. In a terminal, change to the `ibm-garage-iteration-zero` cloned directory
    ```shell script
    cd ibm-garage-iteration-zero
    ```
2. Copy the `credentials.template` file to a file named `credentials.properties`
    ```shell script
    cp credentials.template credentials.properties
    ```
   
   **Note:** `credentials.properties` is already listed in `.gitignore` to prevent the
   private credentials from being committed to the git repository
3. Update the values for `login.user` and `login.password` in `credentials.properties` with your credentials for the OpenShift cluster

    **Note:** The credentials should have been set up during [plan installation](/getting-started-0/plan-installation/hybrid).

### C. Configure the environment variables

The configuration values for provisioning the environment on an existing OpenShift cluster are set in the `environment-ocp.tfvars`
file in the `./terraform/settings` directory of the `ibm-garage-iteration-zero` repository. There are only two values available:

| **Variable**          | **Required?** | **Description**                                                                     | **eg. Value**                 |
|-----------------------|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `server_url`          | yes | The url of the OpenShift cluster's API server                                                 | `https://api.mycluster.com`   |
| `cluster_name`        | no  | The name of the cluster used simply for identification purposes. Defaults to `ocp-cluster`    | `dev-team-one-ocp44`          |

### D. (Optional) Customize the installed components

The `terraform/stages-ocp4` directory contains the default set of stages that define the
modules that will be applied to the environment. The stages can be customized to change
the makeup of the environment that is provisioned by either removing or adding stages from/to the 
`terraform/stages-ocp4` directory. 

**Note:** The stages occasionally have dependencies on other stages (e.g. most all
depend on the cluster module, many depend on the namespace module, etc.) so be aware of those
dependencies as you start making changes. Dependencies are reflected in the `module.{stage name}` references 
in the stage variable list.

The `terraform/stages-ocp4/catalog` directory contains some optional
stages that are prep-configured and can be dropped into the `terraform/stages-ocp4` directory. Other
modules are available from the [Garage Terraform Modules](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/garage-terraform-modules)
catalog and can be added as stages to the directory as well. Since this is Terraform,
any other Terraform scripts and modules can be added to the `terraform/stages-ocp4` directory
as desired.

### E. Run the installation

1. Open a terminal to the `ibm-garage-iteration-zero` directory
2. Launch a [Developer Tools Docker container](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-cli-tools "Cloud Garage Tools Docker image") from which the Terraform scripts will be run
    ```shell script
    ./launch.sh
    ```

    This will download the Cloud Garage Tools Docker image that contains all the necessary tools to execute Terraform scripts
    and exec shell into the running container. When the container starts it 
    mounts the filesystem's `./terraform/` directory as `/home/devops/src/` and loads the values from the
    `credentials.properties` file as environment variables.

3. Apply the Terraform by running the provided `runTerraform.sh` script

    ```shell script
    ./runTerraform.sh
    ```
    
    This script collects the values provided in the `environment-ocp.tfvars` and the
    stages defined in `terraform/stages-ocp4` to build the Terraform workspace. Along the way it
    will prompt for a couple pieces of information.
    
    1. Type of installation: `ibmcloud` or `ocp`
    
        There are two major paths to installing with the Toolkit. In this case, we are installing
        into a hybrid OpenShift instance so we will select `ocp`.
        
        This prompt can be skipped by providing `--ocp` as an argument to `./runTerraform.sh`
    
    2. Handling of an old workspace (if applicable): `keep` or `delete`
    
        If you executed the script previously for the current cluster configuration and the workspace directory still
        exists then you will be prompted to either keep or delete the workspace directory. Keep the workspace directory if
        you want to use the state from the previous run as a starting point to either add or remove configuration. Delete
        the workspace if you want to start with a clean install of the Toolkit. 
        
        This prompt can be skipped by providing `--delete` or `--keep` as an argument to `./runTerraform.sh`

    3. Verify the installation configuration
    
        The script will verify some basic settings and prompt if you want to proceed. After you select **Y** (for yes), 
        the Terraform Apply process will begin to create the infrastructure and services for your environment.
    
        This prompt can be skipped by providing `--auto-approve` as an argument to `./runTerraform.sh`

    Provisioning the tools into an OpenShift takes about 20 minutes, depending on network and storage performance.
