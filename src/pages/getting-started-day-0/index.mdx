<PageDescription>

Provides information for provisioning
an environment using the <Globals name="longName"/>. It describes the available options
and associated considerations for how the environment can be structured. Additionally,
this section provides step-by-step guides to get an environment up and running 
using repeatable Infrastructure as Code components.

## Paths to Installation

The <Globals name="longName"/> <Globals name="env"/> can be hosted in 
any <Globals name="kube"/> or <Globals name="ocp"/> cluster, including those managed by <Globals name="ic"/>. The 
environment is provisioned using [infrastructure-as-code](/getting-started-day-0/infrastucture-as-code) [Terraform scripts](/admin/terraform) that 
make the process declarative, automated, and repeatable.

The scripts are composed of a number of Terraform modules that have been organized into different stages. The first 
stage is responsible for establishing the connection to the cluster (if using an existing cluster) or provisions the
cluster in IBM Cloud before establishing the connection (if provisioning a new cluster). After establishing the connection,
the subsequent stages can connect and perform their activities. 

If a managed <Globals name="ic"/> cluster is not used, 
then the cluster can be provisioned by other means, and the first stage will just expose the cluster configuration 
values. In this case, we would highly recommend provisioning the cluster using other Terraform scripts.

The installation process is organized into three activities:

### [Planning the installation](/getting-started-day-0/plan-installation/ibm-cloud) 

Explains the planning and configuration required to prepare for the installation of the Toolkit.

### [Installing with the toolkit](/getting-started-day-0/install-toolkit/ibm-cloud)

Explains the end-to-end process for provisioning the environment with the Toolkit. Within that process, there two 
primary installation options. Select the approach that best suites your requirements:

* **Install in <Globals name="ic"/>-managed cluster**: Create a new environment in <Globals name="ic"/>, optionally 
  creating a new cluster in the process.

* **Install in existing OpenShift**: Create a new environment in an OpenShift cluster running anywhere.

### [Completing the configuration](/getting-started-day-0/post-installation)

Explains the steps to finalize the setup of the environment and begin on-boarding developers.
