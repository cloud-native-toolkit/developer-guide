<PageDescription>

Provides the instructions to install and setup OpenShift CRC for use with the <Globals name="shortName" />.

</PageDescription>

The <Globals name="longName" /> facilitate development and deployment of cloud-native applications.
They can be hosted in any Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster, including the Red Hat CodeReady Containers local 
OpenShift environment.

These instructions help you install Red Hat CodeReady Containers and explain
how to configure and run the Terraform infrastructure-as-code (IasC) scripts to install the Developer Tools into 
that CodeReady Containers install.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required to support installing CodeReady Containers:

- CodeReady Containers [Minimum system requirements](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_codeready_containers/1.0/html/getting_started_guide/getting-started-with-codeready-containers_gsg#minimum-system-requirements_gsg)
- A [Red Hat account](https://access.redhat.com/login) is required
- [<Blogals name="shortName" /> prerequisites](/getting-started/prereqs)

## Install the CRC binary

Install and configure CRC as described in [Install on Laptop](https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/crc/installer-provisioned)

- Remember to download the **Pull Secret** file

- **CRC executable**: Copy the crc binary to your $PATH:

    From the directory where you unzipped the download:
    ```shell script
    cp crc /usr/local/bin
    ```

## Configure the CRC instance

Follow these steps to complete the installation:

- **Setup**: Run the following command from a terminal session:
    ```shell script
    crc setup
    ```
- **Add memory**: By default, the CRC VM is set to only use 8 GB of RAM. The more RAM you can give it, the better.

    To set the CRC VM to 10 GB of RAM, do this:
    ```shell script
    crc config set memory 10240
    ```

- **Start** the local CRC Cluster

    Run the crc start command in a terminal window:
    ```shell script
    crc start -p {pull-secret-file}
    ```

- Wait about 5 minutes for the VM initialization to complete. When complete, the kubeadmin password will be displayed. Make note of
this password because you will need it to log into the console.

- Open the Cluster Admin **Console**
    ```shell script
    crc console
    ```
- Open a web browser and go to the OpenShift console

- Login with user id **kubeadmin** and the password that was displayed
after the `crc start` had completed.
