Provides the considerations and steps to prepare an OpenShift cluster for
an installation of <Globals name="shortName" /> <Globals name="env" />.

</PageDescription>

## 1. Provision the cluster

Provisioning the OpenShift cluster is the minimum requirement to prepare for the Toolkit install. The cluster could be
OpenShift CRC running on a laptop, a cloud-managed OpenShift cluster on AWS or Azure, or an on-premise install of
OpenShift. We'll leave the steps to provision to you since the details will vary considerably depending upon the 
approach. However, whichever platform you use we highly recommend utilizing or developing automation scripts to 
perform the provisioning, so that it can be done repeatably.

Here are some resources that might help get started:

- [OpenShift CRC setup](./openshift-crc-setup)
- [OpenShift on AWS](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/terraform-openshift4-aws)
- [OpenShift on GCP](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/terraform-openshift4-gcp)
- [OpenShift on Azure](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/terraform-openshift4-azure)
- [OpenShift on VMWare](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/terraform-openshift4-vmware)

The <Globals name="longName" /> is not responsible for maintaining the Terraform scripts provided in the links above
and does not give any guarantee as to their current condition. If there are any issues with those scripts it would be
best to pursue it with the maintainers by raising issues against the appropriate repository.

## 2. Configure access to the cluster

In order to interact with the cluster, user credentials need to be established having Cluster Admin rights. The initial
`kubeadmin` user (or whatever name is used after it is changed) can be used or a new user can be added for use by
the provisioning scripts.

## Next steps

Now that the cluster has been provisioned and the access control has been configured, you are ready to move to the next
step and perform the installation with the Toolkit. Before moving on, be sure to record the following information:

- OpenShift login user (user id with Cluster Admin permission)
- OpenShift login password
- OpenShift server url
