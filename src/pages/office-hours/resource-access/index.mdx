Downloads are available in the Resource Access Management folder in [Office Hours](https://ibm.box.com/v/Office-Hours).

Video will be available TBD.

Quotes from some satisfied listeners:

- "The IAM system is dauntingly complex. Thanks for this presentation and these scripts -- they're a really helpful starting point."
- "This video will be a great asset to put on YouTube and the toolkit site for all those Admin and SREs creating the clusters and setting up the environment for a project."
- "This is the first time I have seen a screen cast showing how IAM works, and how to get it configure and test it with demo users."
