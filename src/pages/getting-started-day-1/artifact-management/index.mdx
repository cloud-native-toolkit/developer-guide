In the DevOps process, Artifact Management generally refers to the activities around storing and managing assets that are
produced during the continuous integration process. Depending upon the development language, an "asset" could be any number
of things:

- Library jar file
- NPM package
- Helm chart
- etc

Besides the contents of the asset, many of those types of artifacts also involve a particular protocol for how they are shared
and consumed (e.g. maven repository for jar libraries).

**Note:** While container images are closely related to the other artifacts listed above, we feel the practices and tools
around managing images is distinct enough that the [Image Registry](/getting-started-day-1/image-registry) warrents its own
treatment.

There are a number of tools available to handle manage artifacts, from roll-your-own file systems to enterprise-grade
software. Currently the <Globals name="shortName" /> supports provisioning the following Artifact Management tools:

- [Artifactory](/tools/artifactory)
- Nexus
