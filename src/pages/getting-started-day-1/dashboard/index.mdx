<PageDescription>

The <Globals name="env" /> includes the Developer Dashboard

</PageDescription>

The Developer Dashboard is one of the tools running in your <Globals name="env" />. It is designed to help you navigate to the installed tools and give you a simple way to perform common developer tasks, such as:
- **Dashboard**: Navigate to the tools installed in the cluster
- **Activation**: Links to education to help you learn cloud-native development and deployment using IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service and Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud
- **<Globals name="templates" />**: Links to templates that will help accelerate your project

With the release of **<Globals name="ocp" />**, it is now even easier for developers to integrate the SDLC tools into the OpenShift console. This console is mainly focused on providing a simple navigation experience when the <Globals name="shortName" /> is installed into <Globals name="iks" />.

Here are some recent improvements:
- More tools can be added to the dashboard using a simple `igc tool-config` command
- Prefix (shown above as "IBM") and Title (shown above as "Cloud Native Toolkit") can be customized to you own names
- The IBM Cloud link can be overidden to support links to other cloud vendors when OpenShift is running on Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, or VMWare
- The tools view is split into more columns to enable more reuse of the screen
- The Cluster information is now available when you click on "Developer Dashboard" title
- The <Globals name="igccli" /> now installs an alias into the `oc` and `kubectl` so it is now possible to open the dashboard quickly using `oc dashboard` and `kubectl dashboard`
 
### Tools configured with OpenShift console

When the administrator configures your <Globals name="env" />, they can customize a set of short cut links to common tools you often use as a developer.

You can see how these tools are configured by reading the [Tools configuration](/admin/config-dashboard)
 
 
### Opening the Dashboard

You can open the Dashboard from a terminal.

- Open a terminal
- Make sure your terminal is logged into your Development cluster
    - In the IBM Cloud console, navigate to your cluster's overview
    - Switch to the **Access** tab
    - Follow the instructions to log in from the command line
- Use the [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli#dashboard) to open the Dashboard in your environment

<Tabs>
<Tab label="OpenShift">

```bash
oc dashboard
```
</Tab>
<Tab label="Kubernetes">

```bash
kubectl dashboard
```
</Tab>
<Tab label="IGC">

```bash
igc dashboard
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

- This will open the Dashboard

### Access the tools URLs

You can open the dashboard for any tool via its URL.

- To list the ingress endpoints for all of the installed tools, use the [Developer Tools CLI](/getting-started/cli) to run the following command:

<Tabs>
<Tab label="OpenShift">

```bash
oc endpoints -n tools
```
</Tab>
<Tab label="Kubernetes">

```bash
kubectl endpoints
```
</Tab>
<Tab label="IGC">

```bash
igc endpoints
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>


- This will return the ingress URLs for all of the tools installed in the Developer Tools cluster.
    ```bash
    ? Endpoints in the 'tools' namespace. Select an endpoint to launch the default browser or 'Exit'.
    
     1) Exit
     2) developer-dashboard - http://dashboard.garage-dev-ocp4-c-518489-0143c5dd31acd8e030a1d6e0ab1380e3-0000.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud
     3) argocd-server - https://argocd-tools.gsi-learning-ocp311-clu-7ec5d722a0ab3f463fdc90eeb94dbc70-0001.eu-gb.containers.appdomain.cloud
     4) artifactory - https://artifactory-tools.gsi-learning-ocp311-clu-7ec5d722a0ab3f463fdc90eeb94dbc70-0001.eu-gb.containers.appdomain.cloud
     5) dashboard - https://dashboard-tools.gsi-learning-ocp311-clu-7ec5d722a0ab3f463fdc90eeb94dbc70-0001.eu-gb.containers.appdomain.cloud
     6) developer-dashboard - http://dashboard.garage-dev-ocp4-c-518489-0143c5dd31acd8e030a1d6e0ab1380e3-0000.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud

    ```

-  You can then select the URL to open the tools' dashboard directly.

### Credentials

In the future, the tools in the Dashboard will be linked using a single sign-on (SSO) service. In the meantime, the CLI includes a command to list the tools' logins.

- To list the logins for all of the installed tools, use the [Developer Tools CLI](../getting-started/cli) to run the following command:

<Tabs>
<Tab label="OpenShift">

```bash
oc credentials
```
</Tab>
<Tab label="Kubernetes">

```bash
kubectl credentials
```
</Tab>
<Tab label="IGC">

```bash
igc credentials
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

- The command lists the `userid` and `password` for each tool installed. You can use these credentials to log into each of the installed tools.
- More of the tools in <Globals name="ocp" /> will be integrated into the OpenShift console login process

If you are using OpenShift, the Jenkins credential will be `undefined` because the OpenShift built in Jenkins service uses IBM cloud single sign-on mechanism.
