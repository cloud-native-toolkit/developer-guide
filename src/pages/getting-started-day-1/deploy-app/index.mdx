Create a sample application and deploy it with a CI pipeline

</PageDescription>

## Overview

The <Globals name="env" /> supports end-to-end development and deployment of an application. The instructions below
will show you how to do it.

You can create a new app using one of the [<Globals name="templates" />](/starterkits). These have been
created to include all the key components, configuration, and frameworks to get you started on creating the code you
need for your solutions. The approach for getting started is exactly the same for an environment based on
**Red Hat OpenShift** or **Kubernetes**.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** The instructions provided below lean heavily on the use of the <Globals name="igccli"/> to both show how the
CLI works in context and to streamline the process (the reason for creating the CLI in the first place). However, the
use of the CLI is in no way required to use the <Globals name="shortName"/>. If you would prefer to work through these
instructions without the use of the CLI, we have provided the equivalent manual steps for each command on
the [Cloud Native Toolkit CLI](/getting-started/cli) page.

This video demonstrates how to work through the steps to create an application and use a deployment pipeline to install
it into your development cluster.

### 1. Log into your Development Cluster from the command line

1. Make sure you have installed all [Prerequisites](/getting-started/prereqs) before continuing
2. Open a terminal
3. Log in to the development cluster's CLI (Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift)

    To do so, navigate to your cluster in the _IBM Cloud console_, click on the **Access** tab, and follow the
    instructions to log in to the cluster from the command line

4. You can test that you're connected to the cluster with the following simple command:

  ```shell script
  oc get pods -n tools
  ```

<InlineNotification kind="info">

**Note:** The remaining steps assume this step has already been performed. If you stop and then come
back later it is a good idea to re-run this step again before proceeding
</InlineNotification>

### 2. Create the development namespace

Before getting started, the development namespace/project needs to be created and prepared for the DevOps pipelines.
This is something that would typically happen once at the beginning of a project as a development team is formed and assigned to the cluster. This step copies the common `secrets` and `configMaps` to your new namespace. This enables the pipelines to reference the values easily for you project.

```shell script
oc sync {DEV_NAMESPACE} --dev
```

### 3. Open the Developer Dashboard

The [Developer Dashboard](/getting-started-day-1/dashboard) makes it easy for you to navigate to the tools, including a
section that allows you to select a set of preconfigured [<Globals name="templates" />](/codepatterns/overview) that
make seeding your development project very easy.

1. Open a browser and make sure you are logged into [Github](https://github.com)
2. Open the dashboard by running the following command:

    ```shell script
    oc dashboard
    ```

### 4. Create your app in Git

<InlineNotification kind="warning">

**Warning:** If you are developing on a shared education cluster, you need to make it easy to identify
your app. Please suffix the app name with your initials `{app name}-{your initials}` (e.g.
`stockbffnode-mjp`) and use the **Git Organization** for the shared environment.

**Warning:** Your browser needs to be logged in to your GitHub account for a template to work. If the link from the
tile displays the GitHub 404 page, log in and reload the page.

</InlineNotification>

1. From the Developer Dashboard, click on **<Globals name="templates" />** tab

2. Pick one of the templates that is a good architectural fit for your application and the language and framework that you prefer to work with.

  Click on a <Globals name="template" /> **Tile** to create your app github repository from the
  template repository selected. You can also click on the **Git Icon** to browse the source template repository and click on the **Template** to create the template

3. Complete the [GitHub create repository from template](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) process.

  **Owner**: Select a validate GitHub organization that you are authorized to create repositories within or the one you were given for the shared cluster (See warning above)

  **Repository name**: Enter a valid name for you repo, GitHub will help with showing a green tick if it is valid (See warning above)

  **Description**: Describe your app

  Press **Create repository from template**

  ![Template](/images/template.png)

The new repository will be created in your selected organization.

### 5. Clone your code

1. With the browser open to the newly created repository, click on **Clone or download**
2. Copy the clone _SSH link_, and use the `git clone` command to clone it to your developer desktop machine.

    ```shell script
    git clone git@github.com:{gitid}/stockbffnode.git
    ```

3. Change into the cloned directory

    ```shell script
    cd stockbffnode
    ```

### 6. Run the application locally

Most developers like to run the code natively in local development environment. To do so, follow the instructions listed in the **README.md** file to run the code locally. You may be required to install a specific runtime like **Java**, **Node** or **Go**.

- If you want to quickly access your git repo you can run a helper command to open the git webpage.
    ```
    oc git
    ```

### 7. Set the namespace context

Before running these remainder of the instructions commands it is important to set the
namespace/project context. (**Notes:** The `kubernetes` command will work for both `openshift`
and `kubernetes`.)

<Tabs>
<Tab label="OpenShift">

```shell script
oc project {DEV_NAMESPACE}
```

</Tab>
<Tab label="Kubernetes">

```shell script
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace={DEV_NAMESPACE}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### 8. Register the App in a DevOps Pipeline

Up to this point you have the code in a GitHub repository and have cloned it to you local development environment. You
now need to register the repository with the continuous integration pipeline. The <Globals name="env" /> supports both
[Tekton](/tools/tekton) and [Jenkins](/tools/jenkins) for continuous
integration.

1. Start the process to create a pipeline

    ```shell script
    oc pipeline
    ```
1. Select the pipeline type for **OpenShift** we recommend **Tekton** as its optimized for Kubernetes based environments.

1. The first time a pipeline is registered in the namespace, the CLI will ask for a username and
**Personal Access Token** for the Git repository that will be stored in a secret named `git-credentials`. It will
also ask for the branch that should be used for the pipeline.

  **Username**: Enter your GitHub user id

  **Personal Access Token**: Paste your GitHub personal access token

  **Branch**: Press enter for the default git branch or type in another branch you want to register

3. When registering a `Tekton` pipeline, you will also be prompted to select which pipeline you want to use for your application. `Gradle` is for Spring and `Node` is for Typescript based Starter Kits.

4. After the pipeline has been created, the command will set up a webhook from the Git host to the pipeline event listener

    **Note:** If the webhook registration step fails it is likely because the Git credentials are incorrect or do not have enough permission in the repository.

    The pipeline will be registered in your development cluster.

### 9. View your application pipeline

The steps to view your registered pipeline will vary based on type of pipeline (`Jenkins` or `Tekton`) and container platform version.

### 10. Access the running app

Once the pipeline has completed successfully, the app will be deployed into the namespace used when
registering the pipeline. To validate the app is running follow these steps:

**Note:** Be sure the namespace context is set correctly before running the following commands -
[set the namespace context](#7.-set-the-namespace-context)

1. Retrieve the app ingress endpoint using commands below in your terminal.

    ```bash
    oc endpoints
    ```

2. From the endpoints listed, select the URL for the repo that was just deployed and press **Enter** to open that URL in a web browser and validate the application is working as expected

### 11. Locate the app in the web console

The build pipeline is configured to build the source code from the Git repository into a container image. This image is stored in the [Image Registry](/tools/ibm-cloud-container-registry). After that the image is deployed into the same namespace/project within development cluster where the pipeline ran and validated for its health. The steps below will walk through locating the installed application within the Web Console.

<Tabs>
<Tab label="OpenShift 4.x">

1. Open the **OpenShift web console**
    ```shell script
    oc console
    ```

<InlineNotification kind="success">

**Success:** You now have your application running inside your development cluster building built with a CI pipeline.

</InlineNotification>

Having reached this point, we recommend you repeat the process a few more times using different starter kits templates and explore the environment to get familiar. For more information about the tools used by the pipeline, check out the [Guides](/tools)

This completes the deployment of your app. The next step is to prepare for Continuous Delivery, Code Analysis, and Artifact Management.
