When you are creating Development environments for teams there are a number of element to consider when 
giving access on the IBM Cloud.

</PageDescription>

## Overview

A <Globals name="env" /> is installed and managed by users acting in two roles:
- **Account administrator**: Account owner or other user with sufficient [account management permissions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/resources?topic=resources-bp_resourcegroups#bp_resourcegroups)
- **Environment administrator**: A user in the account with [the administrator role for all services](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-cloudaccess)

### Teams for Developers 

## Planning Team Topology
    - Cluster per team
    - Big Cluster with Namespace per team contributing into common TEST and PREPROD namespaces with ArgoCD

## Preparing IBM Cloud

## Setup steps
=======
First, before installing an environment, the account administrator needs to configure the IBM Cloud account for the
  environment. See [Configure Account](/admin/config-account) for detailed instructions, which accomplish this:
- Decide which data center (region and zone) will host the environment
- Determine which public/private VLAN pair will comprise the environment's network
- Create the resource group that will contain the environment's resources
- Upgrade the image registry's service plan
- Create the access groups that will enable administrators and developers to access to the environment's resources
>>>>>>> Updates to install, CLI, and dashboard

- Create Resource Group
- Create access group (capatilised )
- Create Cluster in the resource group name it `<team>-iks|ocp-cluster`
    - 3 Node and 8cpu and 33gb memory (typically for a sensibel team)
- Install Developer Tools into cluster following install existing guide
- run `terraform/scripts/Usage: acp <ACCESS_GROUP> <RESOURCE_GROUP> <PREFIX> <REGION>`
- apply RBAC Rules`terraform/scripts/rbac.sh <ACCESS-GROUP>`
- Test `igc dashboard`
- Complete setup of LogDNA
- Complete setup of SysDig
- Test the pipeline by deploying a first app
- Complete setup of Artifactory
- Complete setup of Argo CD
- Rerun pipeline and confirm that the app's Helm chart is added to Artifactory
- Set up a GitOps repo to validate ArgoCD setup and configuration

## Conclusion

Having configured the account, installed the environment, and configured the environment, the administrators have now completed an end-to-end installation of a <Globals name="env" />. It is ready for a development team to begin using for application development.
