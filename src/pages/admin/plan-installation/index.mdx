<PageDescription>

When you are creating Development environments for teams there are a number of element to consider when 
giving access on the IBM Cloud.

</PageDescription>

## Overview

A <Globals name="env" /> is installed and managed by users acting in two roles:
- **Account administrator**: Account owner or other user with sufficient [account management permissions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/resources?topic=resources-bp_resourcegroups#bp_resourcegroups)
- **Environment administrator**: A user in the account with [the administrator role for all services](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-cloudaccess)

### Teams for Developers 

## Planning Team Topology
    - Cluster per team
    - Big Cluster with Namespace per team contributing into common TEST and PREPROD namespaces with ArgoCD

## Setup steps
=======
First, before installing an environment, the account administrator needs to configure the IBM Cloud account for the
  environment. See [Configure Account](/admin/config-account) for detailed instructions, which accomplish this:
- Decide which data center (region and zone) will host the environment
- Determine which public/private VLAN pair will comprise the environment's network
- Create the resource group that will contain the environment's resources
- Upgrade the image registry's service plan
- Create the access groups that will enable administrators and developers to access to the environment's resources
<<<<<<< HEAD
>>>>>>> Updates to install, CLI, and dashboard

- Create Resource Group
- Create access group (capatilised )
- Create Cluster in the resource group name it `<team>-iks|ocp-cluster`
    - 3 Node and 8cpu and 33gb memory (typically for a sensibel team)
- Install Developer Tools into cluster following install existing guide
- run `terraform/scripts/Usage: acp <ACCESS_GROUP> <RESOURCE_GROUP> <PREFIX> <REGION>`
- apply RBAC Rules`terraform/scripts/rbac.sh <ACCESS-GROUP>`
- Test `igc dashboard`

### Install environment

Second, once the account administrator has configured the account for installing an environment, the account administrator and the environment administrator need to jointly decide how the environment administrator is going to install the environment. There are two options:

[**Install including creating a new cluster**](/admin/installation-ibm-cloud): The environment administrator who performs this install needs permissions to create clusters as well as service instances. The script will run as this user to create the cluster, create the service instances, and install the CI/CD tools in the cluster.

[**Install into an existing cluster**](/admin/installation-existing): The account administrator creates the cluster and then grants the environment administrator access to it. The environment administrator who performs this install needs permissions to create service instances but not to create clusters. The script will run as the environment administrator to create the service instances and install the CI/CD tools in the existing cluster.

**Note**: A third option is to [install an environment in Red Hat CodeReady Containers](/admin/installation-crc). For this option, you're not installing in IBM Cloud, so you don't have to configure your IBM Cloud account. However, you do have to install CRC.

### Configure environment

Third, after installing the environment, before giving the developers access to the environment, the environment administrator need to finish configuring it. See [Configure Installation](/admin/config-install) for detailed instructions, which accomplish this:
- Configure RBAC security in the cluster
- Test opening the <Globals name="dashboard" />
>>>>>>> Rename Developer Tools Dashboard
- Complete setup of LogDNA
- Complete setup of SysDig
- Test the pipeline by deploying a first app
- Complete setup of Artifactory
- Complete setup of Argo CD
- Rerun pipeline and confirm that the app's Helm chart is added to Artifactory
- Set up a GitOps repo to validate ArgoCD setup and configuration

## Conclusion

Having configured the account, installed the environment, and configured the environment, the administrators have now completed an end-to-end installation of a <Globals name="env" />. It is ready for a development team to begin using for application development.
