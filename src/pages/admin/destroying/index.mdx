Not only can the <Globals name="shortName" /> create the <Globals name="env" />, the environment can also delete itself. The environment is installed using Terraform, which stores the state of the creation in the `workspace` folder. Terraform can use that state to delete what it installed.

Destroy a <Globals name="env" /> following these steps:

- Run the following command to launch a [Developer Tools container](/guides/tools-image):
    ```bash
    ./launch.sh
    ```

- In the container, change to the `workspace` directory:
    ```bash
    cd workspace
    ```

- In the container, run the Terraform tool with the `destroy` option:
    ```bash
    terraform destroy
    ```

This will remove the development cluster and all the services that were created previously.
