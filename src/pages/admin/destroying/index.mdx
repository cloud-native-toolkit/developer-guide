Not only can the <Globals name="shortName" /> create the environment, the environment can also delete itself. The 
environment is installed using Terraform, which stores the state of the applied modules in the `workspace/{cluster name}` 
folder. Terraform can use that state to delete what it installed.

Destroy a <Globals name="env" /> following these steps:

1. Run the following command to launch a [Developer Tools container](/tools/tools-image):
    ```shell script
    ./launch.sh
    ```

2. In the container, change to the `workspace/{cluster name}` directory:
    ```shell script
    cd workspace/{cluster name}
    ```

3. In the container, run the `destroy.sh` script to apply the Terraform destroy:
    ```shell script
    ./destroy.sh
    ```

    Rather than directly running `terraform desroy`, the `destroy.sh` script first builds a "destroy plan" from the current
    state then applies that plan. Performing the destroy in this way is more reliable and allows for certain resources
    to be selectively destroyed/saved.
