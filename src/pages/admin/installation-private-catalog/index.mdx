Prerequisites

</PageDescription>

The <Globals name="shortName" /> is installed by an IBM Cloud Account administrator. They would run the IasC to create the environment in an IBM Cloud account. The scripts will run as the environment administrator's user. These instructions explain how to configure and run the Terraform (IasC) scripts to create the <Globals name="env" />.

<InlineNotification>

**Note**: The Terraform scripts will clean up the cluster to remove any existing installation that may have been previously been installed.

</InlineNotification>

### Confirm permissions

Optional: To help confirm that the scripts will have the permissions they'll require, the environment administrator may log into the account and test creating a couple of resources:
- [Create a cluster](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/catalog/cluster/create) -- Make it single-zone, and specify the proper data center and resource group
- Create a namespace in the image registry

As long as the user can create these resources successfully the schematics terraform script will be able to apply its state to the cluster.

### Install with IBM Private Catalog Tile

<p></p>

One of the features of the IBM Cloud Catalog is support for private catalog
 tiles. These can contain custom Terraform definitions that can accelerate an
  SRE teams in the execution of common and repetitive tasks. The CNCF DevOps
   tools installation can be configured as a private catalog tile. This is
    the recommend approach for using this asset multiple times. This asset
     enables the easy transition of a default cluster into a cluster that
      supports Cloud-Native CI/CD development tools.

- First step is to create a Catalog, Click **Manage->Catalogs**
- Click on **Create Catalog** , provide a name for example `Team Catalog`
- Click **Update** to change the default resource group for the Catalog
- Click **Create** to complete the Catalog Creation

- Next step is to run the following script to register <Globals name="shortName" />
 tile into the Catalog as an offering. You will need an IBM Cloud API Key

- Download the current release of `create-catalog-offering.sh` from the <a href="https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-iteration-zero/releases" target="_blank">latest releases link</a>
- Allow the script to execute in a command shell `chmod +x create-catalog-offering.sh`
- Run the `create-catalog-offering.sh` scripts passing in the API Key and the name of the
 Catalog that you created
- If you are not running this from the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-shell" target="_blank">Cloud Shell</a> you will need to install `jq` into you command line environment <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/" target="_blank">jq downloads</a>
    ```bash
    chmod +x create-catalog-offering.sh
    ./create-catalog-offering.sh {API_KEY} "Team Catalog"
    ```

To support the running of the Terraform for the <Globals name="shortName" /> installation configure your variables

</PageDescription>

The installation requires a set of variables to be set for to match your environment.

The installation supports Red Hat OpenShift and IBM Kubernetes clusters in both **Classic** and **VPC Gen2** networking configurations.

- Once you have completed the Offering Tile configuration, navigate to the new
 Catalog. You can do this from the IBM Cloud Console select you Catalog ie. `Team Catalog`and click on the **Private** menu on the on the left you can
  select the catalog you have created `Team Catalog`
- Select the **Cloud Native Toolkit** tile
- Enter values for the variables list , these can be customized depending
 on the type of cluster and if its in classic or VPC

    | **Variable**          | **Description**  | **eg. Value**  |
    |-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
    | `cluster_exists`      | Flag indicating that the cluster already exists                                               | `true` or `false`             |
    | `cluster_type`        | The type of cluster into which the toolkit will be installed                                  | `kubernetes` or `ocp4`        |
    | `ibmcloud_api_key`    | The API key from IBM Cloud Console that has ClusterAdmin access and supports service creation | `{guid API key from Console}` |
    | `resource_group_name` | Existing resource group in the account where the cluster has been created                     | `dev-team-one`                |
    | `cluster_name`        | The name of the cluster                                                                       | `dev-team-one-iks-117-vpc`    |
    | `registry_namespace`  | The namespace that should be used in the IBM Container Registry. If not provided the value will default to the resource group name | `dev-team-one-registry-2020` |
    | `vpc_cluster`         | Flag indicating that the cluster has been built on VPC infrastructure                         | `true` or `false`             |

- Input the Environment variables

    - Set them based on the existing cluster:
    - `resource_group_name` -- The existing cluster's resource group
    - `cluster_name` -- The existing cluster's name
    - `registry_namespace` -- The name of a unique Registry namespace to store built images
    - `cluster_exists` -- Set to `true` for an existing cluster
    - `cluster_type` -- Specify the existing cluster's type
        - **kubernetes** -- Kubernetes
        - **openshift** -- OpenShift v3
        - **ocp3** -- OpenShift v3
        - **ocp4** -- OpenShift v4

    - `vpc_cluster` -- true of false if the cluster is inside a VPC

- Accept the License which is **Apache 2** license
- Click **Install**

- This will kick off the installation of the  <Globals name="shortName" />
 into a development cluster using an IBM Cloud Private Catalog Tile.

**Note**: The values for `resource_group_name` and `cluster_name` can be found on the Resource List page in the [IBM Cloud Console](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources) for the cluster you are targeting for the installation.

### IBM Private Catalog Tile

<p></p>

- After you have Accepted the **Apache 2** License and Clicked **Install**

- This will kick off the installation of the <Globals name="shortName" /> into a cluster targeted for development

- Navigate to the **Schematics** service and track the logs for the configuration

- Once complete you can now start to use the development tools in your cloud native project



- Installing the tools into an existing cluster takes about 30 minutes. You can view the workspace logs to see the progress of the execution of the Schematics Terraform scripts

- Once the tools are installed with Terraform using IBM Cloud Schematics you will see this message in the logs
    ```

    <InlineNotification kind="success">

    You have now successfully provisioned and configured the <Globals name="shortName" /> Enjoy!

    </InlineNotification>

### <Globals name="env" />

- In the IBM Cloud console, open the [Resource List](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-ui#dashboardview "Managing resources in the resource list")
- On the Resource List page, filter by your Resource Group (e.g. `dev-team-one`)
- You should see these resources listed:
    - **Clusters**: 1, either Kubernetes or OpenShift
- Select the cluster and open the Kubernetes dashboard or OpenShift web console. You should see:
    - Namespaces: `tools`, `dev`, `test`, and `staging`
    - Deployments in the `tools` namespace: `developer-dashboard`, `jenkins`, etc.


- To get started open the Developer Dashboard or navigate to the tools using the OpenShift Tools menu.

- For more information on how to get start walk through these guides
    - [Deploy your Application](getting-started/deploy-app)

### Possible issues

If you find that that the Terraform provisioning has failed, try deleting the workspace and configure it again.
