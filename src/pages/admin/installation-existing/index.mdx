Prepare to run Terraform to install the Development Tools into an existing IBM Cloud managed cluster

</PageDescription>

The <Globals name="env" /> is installed by an environment administrator, who will run the scripts to create the environment in an IBM Cloud account. The scripts will run as the environment administrator's user, so the user needs the permissions described in [Plan Installation](/admin/plan-installation). These instructions explain how to configure and run the Terraform [infrastructure-as-code](/admin/iasc) (IasC) scripts to create the <Globals name="env" />.

<InlineNotification>

**Note**: The Terraform scripts will clean up the cluster to remove any existing resources that overlap with the resources
provisioned by the scripts. You will need to remember to remove any IBM Cloud services that were previously
created.

Use the helper script `terraform/scripts/destroy-service.sh` to help automate the deletion You can also run it
to remove all the services beside **PostgreSQL** `./destroy-services.sh postgres`

</InlineNotification>

### Prepare local system

To run the scripts, install the client tools needed to use the <Globals name="env" />:
- Install the [Prerequisites](/getting-started/prereqs)

### Test login

Optional: The environment administrator must be able to log into IBM Cloud, specifying the account, region, and resource group. That is effectively what the scripts will do when they run, using the environment administrator's API key.

- Log in to IBM Cloud using the CLI
    ```bash
    ibmcloud login -a cloud.ibm.com -r <region> -g <resource-group>
    ```

### Confirm resources

Optional: To help confirm that the account has the resources the scripts will require (see [Plan Installation](/admin/plan-installation)), the environment administrator may log into the account view the resources:
- [Existing VLANs](https://cloud.ibm.com/classic/network/vlans) -- Verify that the two VLANs specified are in the list and that they are defined in the proper data center
- [Existing resource groups](https://cloud.ibm.com/account/resource-groups) -- Having logged in using the environment's resource group, it should certainly be in the list
- [Existing Kubernetes clusters](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters) -- See what clusters (Kubernetes and OpenShift) already exist in the resource group and confirm one does not already exist for the environment you want to create

### Confirm permissions

Optional: To help confirm that the scripts will have the permissions they'll require (see the administrators access group in [Plan Installation](/admin/plan-installation)), the environment administrator may log into the account and test creating a couple of resources:
- [Create a cluster](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/catalog/cluster/create) -- Make it single-zone, and specify the proper data center and resource group
- Create a namespace in the image registry
- [Create an instance of Cloudant](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/cloudant) -- Select a paid plan and specify the proper region and resource group
- [Create an instance of Sysdig](https://cloud.ibm.com/observe/monitoring/create) -- Select a paid plan and specify the proper region and resource group

As long as the user can create these resources successfully, the scripts should be able to as well. You may delete these test resources.

<Tab label="Download">

<PageDescription>

Obtain the Terraform infrastructure-as-code (IasC) scripts that will install the tools into your IBM Cloud managed cluster

</PageDescription>

- Clone the [ibm-garage-iteration-zero](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-iteration-zero) Git repository to your local filesystem
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-iteration-zero.git
    ```

- Switch to the cloned directory
    ```bash
    cd ibm-garage-iteration-zero
    ```

</Tab>

<Tab label="API key">

<PageDescription>

Configure the key the CLI uses to create cloud services

</PageDescription>

The installation scripts need an API key to authenticate to IBM Cloud.
The following steps create the required API key and put them into a properties file.

- The `credentials.properties` property file looks like this:

    ```bash
    classic.username=<CLASSIC_USERNAME>
    classic.api.key=<CLASSIC_API_KEY>
    ibmcloud.api.key=<IBMCLOUD_API_KEY>
    ```

Since the cluster already exists, we'll only need to set the `ibmcloud.api.key` property.

### Step A. Create the credentials.properties file

- Inside the `ibm-garage-iteration-zero` folder, copy `credentials.template` to a file named `credentials.properties`.

  ```bash
  cd ibm-garage-iteration-zero
  cp credentials.template credentials.properties
  ```

  The `credentials.properties` file is already listed in the `.gitignore` file so that the file containing
your private API key will not be pushed to the server repository.

### Step B. Set the IBM Cloud API key

- Follow these instructions to create an IBM Cloud API key:

    - [Managing user API keys](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-userapikey "Managing user API keys")

- Edit the `credentials.properties` file to set the value for the `ibmcloud.api.key` property.

</Tab>

<Tab label="Configuration">

<PageDescription>

Configure the properties describing the environment

</PageDescription>

The settings for installing the Developer Tools go in a single property file
in the `./terraform/settings` directory:
- `environment.tfvars` -- Properties for installing the Developer Tools

Follow the instructions below to set the existing cluster's details in the `environment.tfvars` file.

### Environment variables

The `environment.tfvars` properties will be used to install the Development Tools.

- Typical values look like this:

    ```bash
    # The type of cluster that will be created/used (kubernetes or openshift)
    cluster_type="openshift"
    # Flag indicating if we are using an existing cluster or creating a new one
    cluster_exists="true"

    # The prefix that should be applied to the cluster name and service names (if not provided
    # explicitly). If not provided then the resource_group_name will be used as the prefix.
    #name_prefix="<name prefix for cluster and services>"
    #name_prefix="garage-cloud-surge"

    # The cluster name can be provided (particularly if using an existing cluster). The value
    # for cluster name used by the scripts will be set in the following order of presidence:
    # - "${cluster_name}"
    # - "${name_prefix}-cluster"
    # - "${resource_group_name}-cluster"
    #cluster_name="<cluster name>"
    cluster_name="garage-cloud-surge-ocp-cluster"

    resource_group_name="garage-cloud-surge"
    vlan_region="us-south"

    # Flag indicating if we are using an existing postgres server or creating a new one
    postgres_server_exists="false"
    ```

<p/>

Set them based on the existing cluster:
- `resource_group_name` -- The existing cluster's resource group
- `vlan_region` -- The existing cluster's region
- `cluster_exists` -- Set to `true` for an existing cluster
- `cluster_type` -- Specify the existing cluster's type
    - **kubernetes** -- Kubernetes
    - **openshift** -- OpenShift v3
    - **ocp3** -- OpenShift v3
    - **ocp4** -- OpenShift v4
    - **crc** -- CodeReady Containers
- `cluster_name` -- The existing cluster's name
- `postgres_server_exists` -- Specify whether the existing cluster already has an existing PostgreSQL service instance

<p/>

<InlineNotification>

**Note**: The values for `resource_group_name` and `cluster_name` can be found on the Resource List
page in the IBM Cloud Console - https://cloud.ibm.com/resources

**Note**: **PostgreSQL** can take some time to provision, so in some cases it is worth manually creating an instance. It needs
to be in the same region and names `<resource-group>-postgresql`.

</InlineNotification>

</Tab>

<Tab label="Run">

<PageDescription>

Run the scripts that create the environment

</PageDescription>

Having configured the `credentials.properties` and `environment.tfvars` properties files, we are now ready to kick off the installation.

Launch a [Developer Tools Docker container](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-cli-tools "Cloud Garage Tools Docker image").

- Run the following command to run the Docker container:
    ```bash
    ./launch.sh
    ```

-  This will install the Cloud Garage Tools Docker image and exec shell into the running container. The container will
    mount the filesystem's `./terraform/` directory as `/home/devops/src/`. Once the Docker container has started and
    the script has exec shelled into it, you will see an IBM Garage banner. This will help you identify you are running
    inside the Docker image that has just mounted your file system.

    For more information on the **Developer Tools Image** see the following guide link below.

- Create the <Globals name="env" />

    The supplied Terraform script is ready to run using the settings in the properties files.
    You optionally can extend or modify the scripts and tailor them for your project's specific needs.

<InlineNotification>

**Note**: If you run this approach multiple times remember to delete any pre existing cloud services that were created previously

</InlineNotification>

- Run this script in the container:
    ```bash
    ./runTerraform.sh
    ```

    This script will create the <Globals name="env" />.

    The script will verify some basic settings and prompt if you want to proceed. After you select **Y** (for yes),
    the Terraform Apply process will begin to create the infrastructure and services for your environment.

    Installing the tools into an existing cluster takes about 30 minutes.

    <InlineNotification kind="success">

    You should now have your <Globals name="env" />
        fully provisioned and configured. Enjoy!

    </InlineNotification>

### <Globals name="env" />

Once the Terraform scripts have finished, you can see the resources that the scripts created in IBM Cloud:
- In the IBM Cloud console, open the [Resource List](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-ui#dashboardview "Managing resources in the resource list")
- On the Resource List page, filter by your Resource Group (e.g. `appdev-team`)
- You should see these resources listed:
    - **Clusters**: 1, either Kubernetes or OpenShift
    - **Services**: 5 or so, such as PostgreSQL, LogDNA, etc.
    - **Storage**: 1, an instance of Cloud Object Storage
- Select the cluster and open the Kubernetes dashboard or OpenShift web console. You should see:
    - Namespaces: `tools`, `dev`, `test`, and `staging`
    - Deployments in the `tools` namespace: `developer-dashboard`, `jenkins`, etc.

### Possible issues

If you find that that the Terraform provisioning has failed, try re-running the `runTerraform.sh` script again.
The state will be saved and Terraform will try and apply the configuration to match the desired end state.

If you find that some of the services have failed to create in the time allocated, you can try this:
- Manually delete the service instances in your resource group
- Delete the `workspace` directory (which will remove any state that has been created by Terraform)
- Re-run the `runTerraform.sh` script
    ```bash
    rm -rf workspace
    ./runTerraform.sh
    ```
