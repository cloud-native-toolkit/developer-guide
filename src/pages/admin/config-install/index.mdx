Configure RBAC security in the cluster:
- Run the RBAC script `./terraform/scripts/rbac.sh <ACCESS-GROUP>`
    - `<ACCESS-GROUP>` is the name of the admin group (i.e. `<resource_group>-ADMIN`)

Other steps:
- Test opening the [<Globals name="dashboard" />](/getting-started/dashboard)
    - Run `igc dashboard`
- Complete setup of LogDNA
- Complete setup of SysDig
- Test the pipeline by [deploying a first app](/getting-started/deploy-app)
- Complete the [Artifactory setup](/admin/artifactory-setup)
- Complete the [Argo CD Setup](/admin/argocd-setup)
- Rerun the pipeline and confirm that the app's Helm chart is added to Artifactory
    - Make any change to the code and push it to the GitHub repo to kick off a pipeline run
    - Confirm the Artifactory repo now contains a Helm chart for your app
- [Set up a GitOps repo](/practical/inventory-part2#using-cd-to-deploy-to-test) to validate ArgoCD setup and configuration
