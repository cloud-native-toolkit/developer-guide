### Post installation Tools setup

The following post installation setup is required to get the development
 enabled quickly, make sure you have completed at least post installation
  tasks. The customization is optional and down to development team needs.

- Apply the `RBAC` Rules to development cluster, this restricts the behaviour
 of the development team. Given them access to create content but not
  manipulate the lower level configuration of the development cluster. 

- Run the RBAC script `./terraform/scripts/rbac.sh {ACCESS-GROUP}`
    - `{ACCESS-GROUP}` is the name of the admin group (i.e. `{resource_group
    }-ADMIN`)

- Check you log data if flowing into [LogDNA](/guides/log-management)
- Complete the setup of [Sysdig](/guides/monitoring#sysdig-dashboard) to check the monitoring data
 is flowing
- Managing development assets is an important part of any **SDLC**, The open
 source version of Artifactory has been installed into the cluster, This
  enables the full end to end process SDLC to be demostrated. This
   version requires some manual configuration after its installation. These
    these instructions can be found here [Artifactory Setup](/admin/artifactory-setup)

- Complete the [Argo CD Setup](continuous-delivery#configuring-gitops-with
-argo-cd), this configures ArgoCD to use Artifactory as a Helm Repository
- Test opening the [<Globals name="dashboard" />](/getting-started/dashboard)
    - Run either or all of the CLI options to load the dashboard `oc dashboard
     | kubectl dashboard | igc dashboard`
- Test the pipeline by [deploying a first app](/getting-started/deploy-app)
- [Set up a GitOps repo](/practical/inventory-part2#using-cd-to-deploy-to-test) to validate ArgoCD setup and configuration
 
### Post installation Customization 

With the <Globals name="shortName" /> now installed into your development
 cluster. It is now possible to customize it further to meet your development
  teams requirements. This maybe to use it for a small squad that just has
   ten developers, or prepare it for a large activation workshop tht could
    have two hundred developers. The following customization helps enable the
     control you need for the developers.


- You can customize tools that are displayed in the <Globals name="dashboard" /> follow these instructions [Customize Dashboard](dashboard#customizing-the-tools-view), the following is an common set that help a developer get quickly to the resourced they need to be productive.
    ```
    igc tool-config --name github --url {url to git org}
    igc tool-config --name ir --url {url image registry}
    igc tool-config --name logdna --url {url to LogDNA instance}
    igc tool-config --name sysdig --url {url to Sysdig instance}
    igc tool-config --name ta --url {url to the Transformation Advisor}
    igc tool-config --name codeready --url {url to the CRW instance}
    igc tool-config --name mcm --url {url to IBM CP4MCM}
    igc tool-config --name integration --url {url to CP4I instance}  
    ```
  
- Generated new passwords for **SonarQube** and update the secret in the
 `tool` namespace
- Test all the installed tools with new passwords
- Test end to end flow for an application and validate the content in each tool

## Optional Tool Configuration

These are optional steps post installation. They do make help with an
 enhanced developer experience.

### Adding Tools to OpenShift Console

You can customize the OpenShift Console. You can extend the tools menu and
 provide fast links to common tools you the development team will require. These tools link are common across the cluster.

![OCP Console Tools](./ocp-console-tools.png)

- From the `terraform/scripts` folded edit the file called `tools.yaml` this
 file contains the CRDs required to configure the menus. You should look
  through this and add custom links for `github`, `logdna` and `sysdig` save
   the file. 

- Make sure you are logged into your cluster from the command line and run
 the following script. You will need the ingress sub domain for your cluster. This can be found on the cluster overview in IBM Cloud.
    ```
    ./config-console-tools {cluster ingress subdomain}
    ```
    
- You can optionaly extend the list of tools using more of the supported
 tools, here is an example extending links to the Cloud Pak for Integration
  and Cloud Pak for Multi Cloud Management.
    ```

### CodeReady Workspace Installation

The following tools can be easily added to your development experience using
 the Red Hat Operator Hub.

CodeReady Workspaces is a developer workspace server and cloud IDE
. Workspaces are defined as project code files and all of their dependencies
 necessary to edit, build, run, and debug them. Each workspace has its own
  private IDE hosted within it. The IDE is accessible through a browser. The
   browser downloads the IDE as a single-page web application. CodeReady
    Workspaces will enable a 100% developer experience to be delivered from a
     users browser. This is perfect for running enablement learning from
      constrained developer laptops, or for SREs to make quick change to a
       microservice.
       
### CodeReady Workspaces Intallation Pre-requisite

Provision  the OpenShift 4.3 Cluster Ensure the logged in user has the
 Administrator Privileges Ensure you have created a new Project to manage the
  "codeready workspace operator & cluster "

Setting up the CRW Operator & Cluster:
- Navigate to Operator Hub and search of the Red Hat Cloudready workspace,
 Click on the operator and select the appropriate workspace to install the CRW operator. 
- Navigate to the installed operator to view the CRW operator. 
- Now click the link visible as part of the operator to create/view the
 CheCluster part of the workspace
- Create the CheCluster button, to navigate to the YAML Configuration
 page (displays all the parameters). 
- You need to change the following parameter mentioned below, As part of
 the storage section, please add the following parameters
    ```    
    postgresPVCStorageClassName: ibmc-block-gold
    workspacePVCStorageClassName: ibmc-block-gold
    ```

- Post definition the yaml section for storage will look as below
    ```
     :storage:
        postgresPVCStorageClassName: ibmc-block-gold
        pvcStrategy: per-workspace
        pvcClaimSize: 1Gi
        preCreateSubPaths: true
        workspacePVCStorageClassName: ibmc-block-gold
    ```

- Now create, the cluster after doing the above changes. The cluster will take few minutes to get created as its resources such as Postgres DB, Keycloak Auth, CRW workspace will get created.
- Once Cluster is created navigate to the overview tab of the CheCluster in
 the CRW operator. You will be able to see the below :
    - URL of the CodeReady Workspaces URL
    - URL of the Red Hat SSO Admin Console URL 
    - oAuth SSO Enabled.
 - This should be enabled by default, if not please slide the button to
  enable and confirm
 - TLS Would be disabled. Please slide the button to enable https connectivity
 to the CRW workspace and confirm
 - You have now completed the provisioning of the Code Ready Workspaces
  operator into your development cluster and will enable it to be used by the
   developers that plan to use this development cluster
