Options for installing the Developer Tools environment

</PageDescription>

## Paths to Installation

The IBM Garage for Cloud Developer Tools environment can be hosted in any Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift cluster, including those managed by the IBM Cloud. The environment is provisioned using [infrastructure-as-code](/admin/iasc) scripting that makes the process declaritive, automated, and repeatable. The provisioning code is implemented as Terraform scripts.

- Before starting any of the installations paths, first install and configure the [prerequisite tools](/getting-started/prereqs).


Select the approach that best suites your requirement:
- **Install new**: Create a new environment in IBM Cloud including a new cluster
- **Install existing**: Create a new environment in IBM Cloud but install it into an existing cluster
- **Install Red Hat CRC**: Create a new environment in *Red Hat CodeReady Containers* installed locally on your laptop
