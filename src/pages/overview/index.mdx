Get familiar with using the <Globals name="longName"/>

</PageDescription>

<Globals name="longName" /> provides an environment for developing cloud-native applications for deployment 
within <Globals name="kube" /> and <Globals name="ocp" />. It
embodies <Globals name="method" /> principles and practices for consistently developed
applications, incorporating best practices that increase developer velocity for efficient delivery of business value.

## Components of the <Globals name="longName" />

As the name suggests, the <Globals name="longName" /> provides a collection of tools that can be used in part or in 
whole to support the activities of software development life-cycle. The following provides a listing of the "tools" that 
make up the <Globals name="shortName" />:

![<Globals name="shortName" />](./images/cntk-in-the-toolkit.png)

- [**CNTK Guides**](#guides) - this set of documentation that weaves the various toolkit components together with a perspective on how to apply cloud-native practices to deliver business solutions 
- [**Infrastucture as Code**](getting-started-day-0/infrastructure-as-code) - Terraform scripts and GitOps configuration to provision and manage the environment
- [**CLI**](/getting-started/cli) - a simple node-based CLI that installs as a plugin to the `kubectl` and `oc` CLIs and provides commands to simplify common
- [**Developer Dashboard**](/getting-started-day-1/dashboard) - Dashboard component and <Globals name="ocp" /> console extensions to simplify common developer activities
- [**DevOps pipelines**](/getting-started-day-1/continuous-integration) - continuous integration pipelines for Tekton and Jenkins
- [**Starter Kits and Code Patterns**](./starterkits) - software repositories that can be used to quickly get started building applications using common patterns, or to serve as a reference to enhance existing patterns
- [**Learning Journey**](/activation) - activation material to teach practitioners how to apply cloud-native practices in real-world scenarios using the <Globals name="tinyName" />

## <Globals name="shortName" /> <Globals name="devenv" />

The <Globals name="shortName" /> <Globals name="devenv" /> includes several features that support 
<Globals name="method" /> best practices for consistent and rapid development of cloud-native applications:

- **Cluster**: A <Globals name="kube" /> or <Globals name="ocp" /> cluster that both hosts the tools and itself is a deployment target for application builds
- **SDLC**: Deployment target environments that support the application development lifecycle: *dev*, *test*, and *staging*
- **Backend services**: Cloud services commonly required by cloud-native applications for monitoring, security, and persistence
- **CI/CD**: A prebuilt, ready-to-run continuous delivery pipeline incorporating best-of-breed open source software tools
- **<Globals name="templates" />**: Prebuilt code templates for common application components and tasks incorporating best practices that developers can add to their codebase as needed
- **Dashboard**: A centralized console to help developers use the environment's capabilities

Typically a [Cloud System Admin](/admin/overview) or a 
[squad lead](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/culture/practice-building-effective-squads/)) installs and sets 
up a new <Globals name="devenv" /> after the [initial inception workshop](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/inception), 
providing a place for the developers to start developing the 
[minimum viable product (MVP)](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/inception/practice_minimum_viable_product). 
The objective is to reduce the time required for a team to configure and prepare their development environment. The key 
benefit is to make the end-to-end [CI/CD development lifecycle](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/deliver/practice_continuous_delivery/) 
consistent across each platform and make the out-of-the-box developer experience as simple as possible.

The installation is performed using [Terraform](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/terraform), driven by scripts with 
a [modular configuration](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/garage-terraform-modules) 
so unneeded tools can be easily disabled or new tools added. The combination of tools selected are proven in the 
industry to deliver real value for modern cloud-native development.

[Red Hat Open Innovation Labs CI/CD components](https://github.com/rht-labs/labs-ci-cd) embodies a very similar approach
to how they deliver success with OpenShift.

### Environment components

After installation, the <Globals name="env" /> consists of the following components and developer tools:
- A development cluster
- A set of backend services
- A set of continuous delivery tools

This diagram illustrates the <Globals name="env" />:

![Provisioned environment](../images/catalyst-provisioned-environment.png)

The diagram shows the components in the environment: the cluster, the deployment target environments, the cloud services, and the tools.

#### Development cluster

The heart of the <Globals key="env" /> is a cluster:

- An [<Globals key="iks" />](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-service)
or [<Globals key="roks" />](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/openshift) 3-node cluster
- Cluster namespace that encapsulates the tooling installed in the cluster: *tools*
