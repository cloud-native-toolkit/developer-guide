## Developer Environment

<Globals name="longName" /> provides an environment for developing cloud-native applications for deployment within Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift. It embodies IBM Garage Method principles and practices for consistently developed applications incorporating best practices that increase developer velocity for efficient delivery of business value.

### Overview

This short video introduces the concepts of DevOps with <Globals name="ocp" />:

Each development team installs its own <Globals name="env" /> into the team's account. The environment includes several features that support <Globals name="method" /> best practices for consistent and rapid development of cloud-native applications:

- **Installation**: The <Globals name="shortName"/> is able to install itself as a new <Globals name="env" />
- **Cluster**: A <Globals name="kube" /> or <Globals name="ocp" /> cluster that both hosts the tools and itself is a deployment target for application builds
- **SDLC**: Deployment target environments that support the application development lifecycle: *dev*, *test*, and *staging*
- **Backend services**: Cloud services commonly required by cloud-native applications for monitoring, security, and persistence
- **CI/CD**: A prebuilt, ready-to-run continuous delivery pipeline incorporating best-of-breed open source software tools
- **<Globals name="templates" />**: Prebuilt code templates for common application components and tasks incorporating best practices that developers can add to their codebase as needed
- **Dashboard**: A centralized console to help developers use the environment's capabilities
- **Red Hat CRC**: The tools can be installed into the RedHat CodeReady Containers environment

A core set of tools are sourced from the [IBM Bitnami Software Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?search=label%3Ahelm#software) that can be found in the <Globals name="ic" />. This approach helps assemble these reliable open source development tools into an end-to-end developer experience that is fully integrated with <Globals name="ic" />'s managed container orchestration services.

Typically a [Cloud System Admin](/admin/overview) (such as a [squad leader](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/culture/practice-building-effective-squads/)) installs and sets up a new <Globals name="env" /> after the [initial inception workshop](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/inception), providing a place for the developers to start developing the [minimum viable product (MVP)](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/inception/practice_minimum_viable_product). The objective is to reduce the time required for a team to configure and prepare their development environment. The key benefit is to make the end-to-end [CI/CD development lifecycle](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/deliver/practice_continuous_delivery/) consistent across each platform and make the out-of-the-box developer experience as simple as possible.

The installation is performed using [Terraform](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/terraform), driven by scripts with a [modular configuration](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/garage-terraform-modules) so unneeded tools can be easily disabled or new tools added. The combination of tools selected are proven in the industry to deliver real value for modern cloud-native development.

[Red Hat Open Innovation Labs CI/CD components](https://github.com/rht-labs/labs-ci-cd) embodies a very similar approach to how they deliver success with OpenShift.

### Environment components

After installation, the <Globals name="env" /> consists of the following components and developer tools:
- A development cluster
- A set of backend services
- A set of continuous delivery tools

This diagram illustrates the <Globals name="env" />:

The diagram shows the components in the environment: the cluster, the deployment target environments, the cloud services, and the tools.

#### Development cluster

The heart of the <Globals key="env" /> is a cluster:

- An [<Globals key="iks" />](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-service)
or [<Globals key="roks" />](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/openshift) 3-node cluster
- Cluster namespace that encapsulates the tooling installed in the cluster: *tools*
- Cluster namespaces for deployment target environments: *dev*, *test*, and *staging*

#### Backend services

The following <Globals key="ic" /> services are created and bound to the cluster:

| Capability                | Service        |Description |
| -----------------------   |:-------------- |------------|
| Log Management            | [Log Analysis with LogDNA](/guides/log-management)  | Manage and analyze app logs  |
| Monitoring                | [Cloud Monitoring with Sysdig](/guides/monitoring)  | Monitor app and platform resources |
| User Authentication       | [App ID](/programming/security/)                    | Verify identities of clients accessing app end points |
| Relational Data Storage   | [Databases For PostgreSQL](/programming/databases) (used by SonarQube) | Stores relational data structured as schemas for SQL querying |
| Schemaless Data Storage   | [Cloudant](/programming/databases)                  | NoSQL database for JSON documents |
| Binary Data Storage       | [Cloud Object Storage](/programming/databases)      | Storage service commonly used for binary content |

#### Continuous delivery tools

The following best-of-breed open source software tools are installed in the cluster's *tools* namespace:

| Capability                  | Tool           | Bitnami |Description |
| --------------------------- |:-------------- | ------- |------------|
| Continuous Integration      | [Jenkins CI](/guides/continuous-integration/)            |  Yes    | Jenkins is a common tool for Continuous Integration   |
| Continuous Integration      | [Tekton CI](/guides/continuous-integration-tekton)       |         | Tekton is an emerging tool for Continuous Integration with Kubernetes and OpenShift  |
| API Contract Testing        | [Pact](/guides/contract-testing/)                        |         | Pact enables API contract testing |
| Code Analysis               | [SonarQube](/guides/code-analysis)                       |  Yes    | SonarQube can scan code and display the results in a dashboard |
| Container Image Registry    | [IBM Cloud Container Registry](/guides/image-registry)   |         | Stores container images to be deployed |
