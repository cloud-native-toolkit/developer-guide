Recording of the presentation: [Office Hours - Access Control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eayMGvkLZmI).

[Resource Access Management](/toolkit-resources/resource-mgmt) is an article that describes the content and includes the recording.

Quotes from some satisfied listeners:

- "The IAM system is dauntingly complex. Thanks for this presentation and these scripts -- they're a really helpful starting point."
- "This video will be a great asset to put on YouTube and the toolkit site for all those Admin and SREs creating the clusters and setting up the environment for a project."
- "This is the first time I have seen a screen cast showing how IAM works, and how to get it configure and test it with demo users."
