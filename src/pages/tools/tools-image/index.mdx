The <Globals name="env" /> includes the CLI Tools Docker image

</PageDescription>

The [IBM Garage command-line tools](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-cli-tools "IBM Garage for Cloud Developer Tools Docker image") is a Docker image with many useful IBM Cloud CLI tools already installed. Rather than installing all of these tools on your local computer, you can simply pull and run this image.

## Running the client

<InlineNotification>

You must [install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) on your local computer to run this Docker image.

</InlineNotification>

Start the client to use it.

- To run the `icclient` container:

    ```bash
    docker run -itd --name icclient ibmgaragecloud/cli-tools
    ```

    This  assumes the image's default name, `ibm-garage-cli-tools`.

Once the client is running in the backgroud, use it by opening a shell in it.

- To use the `icclient` container, exec shell into it:

    ```bash
    docker exec -it icclient /bin/bash
    ```

    Your terminal is now in the container. 

Use this shell to run commands using the installed tools and scripts.

When you're finished running commands, to exit the client.

- To leave the `icclient` container shell, as with any shell:

    ```bash
    exit
    ```

    The container will keep running after you exit its shell.

If the client stops:

- To run the `icclient` container again:

    ```bash
    docker start icclient
    ```

The `icclient` container is just a Docker container, so all [Docker CLI commands](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/) work.

## Using the client

From a client shell, run `image-help` to get a list of available tools, scripts, and ENV properties:
 
  ```bash

   > CLUSTER_NAME - the name of the kubernetes cluster in IBM Cloud
   > SL_USERNAME - the Classic Infrastructure user name or API user name (e.g. 282165_joe@us.ibm.com)
