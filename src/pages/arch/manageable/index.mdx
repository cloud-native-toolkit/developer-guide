Develop applications that can be managed well in production

</PageDescription>

The <Globals name="env" /> is designed to support best practices for developing cloud-native applications that can be managed well in production, known as [built to manage](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/code/build-to-manage). Such components implement endpoints to make them manageable:
- **Health**: The component provides a `/health` endpoint that answers whether it's running successfully, `UP` or `DOWN`.
- **Metrics**: The component provides a `/metrics` endpoint that answers measurements of both the system and application.
- **Readiness**: Kubernetes verifies whether a pod is ready to start receiving traffic, typically by probing the component's `/health` endpoint.
- **Liveness**: Kubernetes verifies whether a pod should be restarted, typically by probing the component's `/health` endpoint.
Kubernetes and the environment's Ops tools for monitoring use these endpoints to report the status of the application's components, which can be used to make the applications self-healing.

Another important feature is for components to log a history of their significant actions:
- **Logging**: Log status to `stdout` indicating level of severity (such as `info`, `debug`, `warn`, `error`, and `fatal`).

The environment's Ops tools for logging will gather and display this history.

An easy way to get started with this architecture is by using one of the [<Globals name="templates" />](/starterkits) to create the skeleton for each microservice.
