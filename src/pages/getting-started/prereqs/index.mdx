Install and configure these tools needed to use the <Globals name="env" />

</PageDescription>

To install and use the <Globals name="shortName" /> <Globals name="env" />, first setup the following prerequisites. Both developers and administrators will need these tools.

This guide assumes that you have some basic knowledge of Kubernetes, Docker
, and modern software delivery techniques including CI/CD. To learn more
 about these topics, after installing the environment, consult the
  educational materials listed in the Activation section [Cloud Native
   Deployment
  ](/activation/cloudnative-deployment).



## Create accounts

You'll need these accounts to use the <Globals name="env" />.

- [GitHub account](http://github.com) (public, not enterprise): Create one if you do not have one aleady. If you have not logged in for a while, make sure your login is working.

- [IBM Cloud Account](https://cloud.ibm.com): Create one if needed, make sure you can log in. 
    - If you're going to [create a cluster](/admin/installation-ibm-cloud), your user needs to be a [member of a paid account](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-iamuserinv) and have permissions to create a cluster.



### Configure Github Personal Access Token
For your CI pipeline ([Jenkins](/tools/continuous-integration), [Tekton](/tools/continuous-integration-tekton), etc.) to connect to and use your GitHub repo, it will need a [GitHub personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) with `public_repo` and `write:repo_hook` scopes. The Personal Access Token only needs to be generated once because it is associated with the GitHub organization and can be used to access any of the organization's repos.

  - Navigate to [Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and generate a new token; name it something like "CI pipeline"
  - Select `public_repo` scope to enable git clone
  - Select `write:repo_hook` scope so the pipeline can create a web hook

  - The GitHub UI will never again let you see this token, so be sure to save the token in your password manager or somewhere safe that you can access later on



## Install CLIs and tools

The following is a list of desktop tools required to help with installation and development.

- [Git Client](https://git-scm.com/): Needs to be installed in your development operating system, it comes as standard for Mac OS

- [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started): Required for management of IBM Cloud Account and management of your managed IBM Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift clusters
    - Don't install just the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-install-ibmcloud-cli), install the [IBM Cloud CLI and Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started#step1-install-idt)
    ```shell script
    curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash
    ```
    - Note: If you log in to the web UI using SSO, you'll need to 
    [create an API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-federated_id) for logging into the CLI. (You can also 
    use this API key for [installing with the <Globals name="shortName" />](/getting-started-day-0).)

- [OpenShift OC CLI](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/latest/): Required for Red Hat OpenShift management and development
    - Download the appropriate **client** tar ball
    - Open a terminal and change to the directory where the tar ball was downloaded
    - Create a directory for the tar ball contents
    ```shell script
    mkdir ./openshift-client
    ```
    - Change to the new `openshift-client` directory and unpack the tar ball
    ```shell script
    cd openshift-client
    tar xzf ../openshift-client-{platform}-{version}.tar.gz
    ```
    - Copy the `oc` and `kubectl` commands from the unpacked folder into your Terminal `PATH` (e.g. /usr/local/bin)
    ```shell script
    cp kubectl /usr/local/bin
    cp oc /usr/local/bin
    ```
    <br/>
    <InlineNotification >

    Depending on your MacOS security settings you may need to allow access to `oc` and `kubectl`. If you are presented with a security warning the first time
    using the command, go to `System Preferences`=>`Security & Privacy` and press `Allow Anyway`*

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/): Required for running the [IBM Garage for Cloud CLI](/getting-started/cli)
    - Installed on your local machine

- [IBM Garage for Cloud CLI](/getting-started/cli): Used to help make working with the development tools as easy as possible
    ```shell script
    npm i -g @ibmgaragecloud/cloud-native-toolkit-cli
    ```
  
    *Note:* If you are adventurous, you can install the beta version of the cli that contains upcoming features with the 
    following command (switch back at any time with the above command):
    ```shell script
    npm i -g @ibmgaragecloud/cloud-native-toolkit-cli@beta
    ```

- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/): A powerful command-line processor for JSON files used to support (and simplify) some commands

- [Tekton CLI](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli): Used to help control Tekton pipelines from the command line.
    ```shell script
    brew tap tektoncd/tools
    brew install tektoncd/tools/tektoncd-cli
    ```

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download): A popular code editor
    - You will be required to edit some files, having a good quality editor is always best practice
