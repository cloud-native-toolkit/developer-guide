<PageDescription>

The Developer Tools include the IBM Garage for Cloud (IGC) Developer Tools Command Line Interface (CLI)

</PageDescription>

The [IGC CLI](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-cloud-cli) 
provides a set of helpful utilities that can be invoked from the command line. Its key objective is to make complicated CLI tasks and `YAML`,`configMap` and `secret` configuration easier for a developer.

These utilities include:
- Register your application's git repo into a CI pipeline ([Jenkins](/guides/continuous-integration), [Tekton](/guides/continuous-integration-tekton), etc.)
- List the ingress URLs for the tools installed in the environment
- List the user names and passwords for the tools installed in the environment
- Build and deploy images to the environment using the IBM Cloud Image Registry
- Help copy `configMaps` and `secrets` into new projects/namespace in Kubernetes or OpenShift

To use the IGC CLI, it must be installed and your terminal and you are logged into IBM Cloud with the IBM Cloud CLI.

## Installation

Follow these steps to use the IGC CLI:
- Install the CLI:
    ```bash
    npm i -g @garage-catalyst/ibm-garage-cloud-cli
    ````
- Run the CLI's help command to list the available commands:
    ```bash
    igc --help
    ```

    The help output looks like this:

    ```bash
    % igc --help
    IBM Garage Cloud CLI

    Usage: igc <command> [args]

    Commands:
      igc jenkins-auth           Generate a Jenkins api token and register it as
                                 kubernetes secret
      igc gen-token              Generate a Jenkins api token
      igc pipeline               Register a pipeline for the current code repository
                                 in Jenkins                      [aliases: register]
      igc git-webhook            Create a git webhook for a given Jenkins pipeline
      igc dashboard              Open the dashboard url in the default browser
      igc build                  Build the image and push it into the IBM Cloud
                                 registry
      igc deploy                 Deploy an image from the IBM Cloud registry into a
                                 kubernetes cluster
      igc tools                  Launch the IBM Garage for Cloud tools image
                                 connected to the current directory
      igc vlan                   Print out the vlan values
      igc credentials            Lists the urls and credentials for the tools
                                 deployed to the cluster
      igc ingress                List the current ingress hosts for deployed apps in
                                 a namespace
      igc tool-config            Create the config map and secret for a tool
                                 configured in the environment
      igc namespace <namespace>  Create a namespace (if it doesn't exist) and
                                 prepare it with the necessary configuration

    Options:
      --version  Show version number                                       [boolean]
      --help     Show help
    ```

## Use the CLI

To use the IGC CLI you must be logged into your
IBM Cloud account using the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli "IBM Cloud CLI and Developer Tools").

- Log into your IBM Cloud account with the correct region and resource group:
    ```bash
    ibmcloud login -a cloud.ibm.com -r <region> -g <resource group>
    ```

- Once logged in, you can use the CLI commands.

    For example, this command lists the dashboard ingress URLs for all of the install tools in the tools namespace:

    ```bash
    igc ingress -n tools
    ```

## Available commands

### vlan

Lists the `vlans` for a particular `resource group` and `region`. The command
expects that an `ibmcloud login` has already been performed to set up the
environment. This information is useful for preparing Terraform cluster creation steps

### credentials

Prints the urls and credentials for the tools deployed into the cluster.
This includes Jenkins, Argo CD, and SonarQube, Pact, Artifactory.

### ingress

Lists the ingress urls for the provided namespace. If no namespace
is provided, `dev` is used.

### pipeline

Registers a git repository project as a Jenkins pipeline by creating a Kubernetes secret to hold
the Git authentication information, calling the Jenkins API, and creating a web-hook.
This command is intended to be run within the repository directory of a project for
which a pipeline should be generated. You can supply a new namespace for your pipeline

```
igc pipeline -n team-a
```

The pipeline command supports both `jenkins` and `tekton` pipelines using the flags `--jenkins` or `--tekton`,
respectively.  Jenkins is the default if no value is provided.

### namespace

Creates a new namespace/project in your cluster and copies the necessary `configMaps` and `secrets` from the `tools` namespace.
This enables new pipelines to be registered and run and for them to have access to all the essential data needed to access the tools and the IBM Cloud platfrom.

### tools

Launches the `ibm-garage-cli-tools` docker image in an interactive
terminal. This image provides commonly used infrastructure tools like,
`terraform`, `kubectl`, `oc` etc.

### enable

"Enables" an existing project with the DevOps infrastructure. The CLI reads the available pipelines from a pipeline
repo and applies the selected pipeline. This command is intended to be run within the repository directory of a project for
which a pipeline should be enabled.

The default pipeline repo is `https://ibm-garage-cloud.github.io/garage-pipelines/` but a different one can be used by
providing the `--repo` argument.  The source for the provided pipeline repo can be found at `https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/garage-pipelines`
