import Globals from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/templates/Globals';

## First steps

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, be sure to install the [<Globals name="shortName" /> prerequisites](./prereqs). The prerequisites
contain a number of CLIs and tools that are essential for cloud-native provisioning, development, and operations.

### CLI overview

One of the components of the <Globals name="shortName" /> is the [<Globals name="igccli" />](./cli) that provides a set 
of commands to simplify common tasks that are performed often by all the personas during the cloud-native software
development life-cycle. The [<Globals name="igccli" />](./cli) documentation aims to make known the various commands
that are available and de-mystify what actions it performs.

## Paths

The <Globals name="longName" /> supports the full Software Development Life-Cycle (SDLC). As such the **Getting Started** guide 
has been divided into:

<Row>
<Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterMdLeft>
<ArticleCard
    color="dark"
    title="Day 0 (System Admins)"
    subTitle={"Creating the environment using " + Globals.get('longName')}
    href="/getting-started-day-0"
    >
