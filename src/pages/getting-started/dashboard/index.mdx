<PageDescription>

The <Globals name="env" /> includes the Developer Dashboard

</PageDescription>

The Developer Dashboard is one of the tools running in your <Globals name="env" />. It is designed to help you navigate to the installed tools and give you a simple way to perform common developer tasks, such as:
- **Dashboard**: Navigate to the tools installed in the cluster
- **Activation**: Links to education to help you learn cloud-native development and deployment using IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service and Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud
- **<Globals name="templates" />**: Links to templates that will help accelerate your project

### Opening the Dashboard

- Open a terminal
- Make sure you are logged into your Development cluster in a terminal.
- To do so, navigate to your cluster in the _IBM Cloud Console_, click on the **Access** tab and
follow the instructions to login from the command line
- You can test this with the following simple command.

<Accordion>

  <AccordionItem title="OpenShift">

    oc get pods

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Kubernetes">

    kubectl get nodes

  </AccordionItem>

</Accordion>

<p></p>

- To open the Dashboard, use the [IGC CLI](/guides/cli).
    ```
    igc dashboard
    ```

- This will open the Dashboard

### Access the tools URLs

- To list the ingress endpoints for all of the installed tools, use the [Developer Tools CLI](../getting-started/cli) to run the following command:
    ```bash
    igc endpoints -n tools
    ```

- This will return the ingress URLs for all of the tools installed in the Developer Tools cluster.
    ```bash
   ? Endpoints in the 'tools' namespace. Select an endpoint to launch the default browser or 'Exit'.
   
     1) Exit
     2) developer-dashboard - http://dashboard.garage-dev-ocp4-c-518489-0143c5dd31acd8e030a1d6e0ab1380e3-0000.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud

     Answer:
    ```

-  You can then select the URL to open the tools' dashboard directly.

### Credentials

In the future, the tools in the Dashboard will be linked using a single sign-on (SSO) service. 
In the meantime, the CLI includes a command to list the tools' logins.

- To list the logins for all of the installed tools, use the [Developer Tools CLI](../getting-started/cli) to run the following command:
    ```bash
    igc credentials
    ```

- The command lists the `userid` and `password` for each tool installed. You can use these credentials to log into each of the installed tools.

<InlineNotification>

If you are using OpenShift, the Jenkins credential
will be `undefined` because the OpenShift built in Jenkins service uses IBM cloud single sign-on mechanism.

</InlineNotification>

### Customizing the Tools view

The tools dashboard supports a collection of tools links. These links can be
 added to the <Globals name="env" /> using the `igc` command line. This
  enables a level of customization for the development. You can use this to
   link out to your Cloud Pak main dashboards, or you can add a reference to
    your Github project. 
    
- To add a tool follow the syntax below.  
    ```bash
    igc tool-config --name <name of tool> --url <url of tool> 
    ```

The following is a list of supported tools that be configured for displayed.
