The <Globals name="env" /> includes the Developer Dashboard

</PageDescription>

The Developer Dashboard is one of the tools running in your <Globals name="env" />. It is designed to help you navigate to the installed tools and give you a simple way to perform common developer tasks, such as:
- **Dashboard**: Navigate to the tools installed in the cluster
- **Activation**: Links to education to help you learn cloud-native development and deployment using IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service and Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud
- **<Globals name="templates" />**: Links to templates that will help accelerate your project

With the release of **<Globals name="ocp" />** it is now even easier for
 developers to integrate the SDLC tools into the OpenShift console. This
  console is mainly focused on providing a simple navigation experience when
   the <Globals name="shortName" /> is installed into <Globals name="iks" />.

Here are some recent improvements:
- More tools can be added to the dashboard using a simple `igc tool-config
` command
- Prefix and Title can be customised to you own names
- The IBM Cloud link can be overidden to support links to multi cloud vendors
 when OpenShift is running on Azure, AWS or Google Cloud and VMWare
- The tools view is split into two 4 columns to enable more reuse of the screen
- The Cluster information is now available when you click on `Developer
 Dashboard` title
- The <Globals name="igccli" /> now installs an alias into the `oc` and
 `kubectl` so it is now possible to open the dashboard quickly using `oc
  dashboard` and `kubectl dashboard`
 
### Tools configured with OpenShift Console

When the <Globals name="shortName" /> was configured for your development
 cluster. The administrator can now configure a set of short cut links to
  common tools you often use as a developer.

You can see how these tools are confgured by reading the [Tools configuration
](/admin/config-install)
 
 
### Opening the Dashboard

- Open a terminal
- Make sure you are logged into your Development cluster in a terminal.
- To do so, navigate to your cluster in the _IBM Cloud Console_, click on the **Access** tab and
follow the instructions to login from the command line

- You can open the Dashboard from the enviornment you are configured with, use the [IGC CLI](/guides/cli#dashboard).
    ```
    oc dashboard | kubectl dashboard | igc dashboard
    ```
  
- This will open the Dashboard

### Access the tools URLs

- To list the ingress endpoints for all of the installed tools, use the [Developer Tools CLI](../getting-started/cli) to run the following command:
    ```bash
    oc endpoints -n tools | kubectl endpoints | igc endpoints
    ```

- This will return the ingress URLs for all of the tools installed in the Developer Tools cluster.
    ```bash
   ? Endpoints in the 'tools' namespace. Select an endpoint to launch the default browser or 'Exit'.
   
     1) Exit
     2) developer-dashboard - http://dashboard.garage-dev-ocp4-c-518489-0143c5dd31acd8e030a1d6e0ab1380e3-0000.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud

     Answer:
    ```

-  You can then select the URL to open the tools' dashboard directly.

### Credentials

In the future, the tools in the Dashboard will be linked using a single sign-on (SSO) service. 
In the meantime, the CLI includes a command to list the tools' logins.

- To list the logins for all of the installed tools, use the [Developer Tools CLI](../getting-started/cli) to run the following command:
    ```bash
    oc credentials | kubectl credentials | igc credentials
    ```
- The command lists the `userid` and `password` for each tool installed. You can use these credentials to log into each of the installed tools.
- More of the tools in <Globals name="ocp" /> will be integrated into the
 OpenShift console login process 

<InlineNotification>

If you are using OpenShift, the Jenkins credential
will be `undefined` because the OpenShift built in Jenkins service uses IBM cloud single sign-on mechanism.

</InlineNotification>

### Customizing the Tools view

The tools dashboard supports a collection of tools links. These links can be
 added to the <Globals name="env" /> using the `igc` command line. This
  enables a level of customization for the development. You can use this to
   link out to your Cloud Pak main dashboards, or you can add a reference to
    your Github project. 
    
- To add a tool follow the syntax below.  
    ```bash
    igc tool-config --name <name of tool> --url <url of tool> 
    ```

The following is a list of supported tools that be configured for displayed.

### Customizing the Dashboard

After the Dashboard has been installed into you development cluster. You can
 customized some of the paramters that enable you to make it tailored to you
  teams needs. You can change the Title , Prefix, and Cloud Console links by
   adding the following Environment variables to you deployment yaml.
   
   You can also tailor the list of content that is displayed in the
    Activitation tab and the Code Patterns tab by creating your own version
     of the [`links.json`](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/developer-dashboard/blob/master/public/data/links.json) JSON file and host that somewhere accessible to you
      clusters network.
      
- Add the following environment variables to the Dashboard instances in the
 `tool` namespace.
    ```
    env:
        - name: DASHBOARD_TITLE
          value: GSI Labs Sandbox
        - name: DASHBOARD_PREFIX
          value: IBM 
        - name CLOUD_TITLE
          value: Azure Console
        - name: CLOUD_URL
          value: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/
        - name: LINKS_URL
          value: http://<url>/data/links.json
    ```
