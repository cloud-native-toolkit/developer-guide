_This is a work in progress, come back for updates._

Steps to install the <Globals name="shortName" /> in an existing OpenShift cluster using a declarative approach with ArgoCD.

</PageDescription>

## Pre-requisites
The following is required before proceeding to the next section.
  * Provision an OpenShift cluster.
  * Install the `oc` and `git` cli.
  * Install the [Cloud Native Toolkit CLI](https://cloudnativetoolkit.dev/getting-started/cli).

---

## Installation
1. Fork the [multi-tenancy-gitops](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/multi-tenancy-gitops) repository and clone your fork.
    ```shell script
    git clone git@github.com:{gitorg}/multi-tenancy-gitops.git

    cd multi-tenancy-gitops
    ```

2. Update the cloned repository with your GitHub Organization.
  - Search and replace all instances of `github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/multi-tenancy-gitops.git` with `github.com/{gitorg}/multi-tenancy-gitops.git`.
  - Commit and push your changes to your fork.
  ```
  git commit -m "Update github organization"
  git push origin master
  ```

3. The gitops repository is structured into different layers (ie. `1-apps`, `2-services`, `3-infra`).  Each layer is structured in a similar pattern consisting of the following:

  - The `argocd` folder contains a set of ArgoCD Application YAMLs.
  - The set of folder(s) in each layer contains the resource YAMLs which will be deployed.
  ```
  tree . -L 2
  .
  ├── 0-bootstrap
  │   └── argocd
  ├── 1-apps
  │   ├── argocd
  │   └── instances
  ├── 2-services
  │   ├── argocd
  │   ├── instances
  │   └── operators
  ├── 3-infra
  │   ├── argocd
  │   ├── clusterrole
  │   ├── consolelink
  │   ├── consolenotification
  │   └── namespaces
  ├── 4-rhacm
  │   └── argocd
  ├── README.md
  └── bootstrap.yaml
  ```

  - Each `argocd` folder contains an `active` and `inactive` sub-folder.  For each layer, select the ArgoCD Appliation YAMLs to deploy and move them into the `active` folder.

  ```
  1-apps/argocd/
  ├── active
  └── inactive

  2-services/argocd/
  ├── active
  └── inactive

  3-infra/argocd/
  ├── active
  └── inactive
  ```

  -  Commit and push your changes to your fork.
  ```
  git commit -m "Update github organization"
  git push origin master
  ```

4. Install the Red Hat OpenShift GitOps operator using the commands below or directly from the OpenShift Web Console.  An instance of ArgoCD will automatically be created in the `openshift-gitops` namespace.
  ```shell script
  oc apply -f 2-services/operators/openshift-gitops/ -n openshift-operators
  ```

  - Verify you can log on to the ArgoCD Web Console.
  ```
  # ArgoCD Web Console URL
  echo https://$(oc get route argocd-cluster-server -o jsonpath='{ .spec.host }' -n openshift-gitops)

  # Admin password
  oc extract secret/argocd-cluster-cluster --to=- -n openshift-gitops
  ```

5. Review and apply the custom ClusterRole permissions to the ArgoCD Application Controller service account.  This is required for ArgoCD to create the required Kubernetes resources in target namespaces.
  ```shell script
  oc apply -f 3-infra/clusterrole/
  ```

6. Create the bootstrap ArgoCD application.

  The bootstrap application will create the parent ArgoCD Application for each layer (YAMLs are located in `0-bootstrap` folder).
  The parent ArgoCD Applications will subsequently create the ArgoCD Applications in the `/argocd/active` directory.

  Depending on what resources have been selected, it will take some time for the ArgoCD to deploy the resources.
 ```shell script
 oc apply -f bootstrap.yaml -n openshift-gitops
 ```

7. From the OpenShift Web Console, verify the resources (ie, operators, namespaces, etc) have been successfully created and/or deployed.
