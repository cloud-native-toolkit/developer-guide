## Overview

To complement the IBM Cloud for Garage Development Tools this project provides
a set of **Starter Kit Templates**. These have been designed to give a production ready
entry point for cloud native development. While use of the **Starter Kit Templates** is not required to be able
to use the development tools, their use is **highly recommended**.

There are a small number of templates that provide support for different architecture layers of your Kubernetes
solution these includes:

- User Interfaces
- Backend for Backends
- Microservices
- Machine Learning (coming soon)

You can pick the starter kit template that best meets your requirements and it will seamlessly integrate
with the installed development tools.

You can work with [Code Patterns](https://developer.ibm.com/patterns/) from  [developer.ibm.com](https://developer.ibm.com/).
These patterns can be "enabled" using the `Bring your own code` approach on [Starter Kit templates](../starterkittemplates).
Even though they are "enabled" they are not optimised for production usage and do not include a number of key IBM Garage best practices.
They are fully open source and they can be enhanced overtime.

There is more information below on what is included in the **Starter Kit Templates**.

## Why another code template

As teams have built out production solutions using IBM Kubernetes Services and RedHat OpenShift
on the IBM Cloud it has became clear that starting with a `hello-world` type template slows down a project.

In cases where you are learning the basic principles of cloud native development with a specific language it does help
to start with the basic principles of `hello-world` but when you are building production code to be used by real users
it takes a lot of effort to industrialize this code ready for production.

The objective of the *Starter Kit Templates* is to kick off a project quickly so they can reach maximum development
velocity in the least amount of time. To not contain any business logic and to have a set of proven opinionated
frameworks that are commonly used in the industry this can include `Express`, `React` and testing frameworks.

Why starter kit templates ? As the approach to cloud native microservice development has evolved
a number of language frameworks have come into play, runtime configuration technologies and best practices
to improve quality and robustness. It becomes very time consuming to create, manage and maintain these elements.

If we look at a typical cloud native app, they require a number of supporting files, similar to the ones
found in the outer ring of this diagram. They take time to create and are only often needed for the initial
seed of the project. Its also never clear where the documentation is for these elements and how they are work together.

Some typical examples :

- Dockerfile
- Helm chart
- CI pipeline ([Jenkins](/guides/continuous-integration), [Tekton](/guides/continuous-integration-tekton), etc.)
- TDD Frameworks
- Code Analysis
- Monitoring / Logging Support
- Cloud Service bindings and credentials
- User Case logic UI, BFF, Microservice

The Starter Kits provide a key number of these supporting files and meta data and are tested on every code change to make sure they work with IBM Kubernetes and IBM Red Hat OpenShift managed clusters.

The purpose of the Starter Kit Template is to provide the scaffold code for the elements outside of your working
use case business logic. This will then allow you to get started a lot quicker and allow you to push code regularly into your CI environment.

## What constitutes a good template

If you want to contribute a **Starter Kit Template** have a look at the examples that are provided. They all have most of the
features listed below. They must be UBI ([Universal Base Image](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image)) based
so they can run in Red Hat OpenShift as well as Kubernetes. They must have a `Dockerfile` that uses that UBI.
To make them work with continuous integration, you can provide a Jenkins or Tekton pipeline.

Make sure there is a good use case that is repeatable in your solution architecture. Make sure the code is documented and includes a `README.md'. There is good code coverage for tests and you have integrated SonarQube code scanning on the build process.
Finally them put in open source so other developers can enhance, improve or consume.

- README
- License
- Package.json
- Use case example source code for example APIs, UIs, Dashboards, Machine learning models
- Unit test framework
- Pact test framework
- Integration testing including User Experience tests
- SonarQube scan integration
- Dockerfile using Universal Base Image
- Helm chart that is production ready
- Jenkinsfile or Tekton pipeline that is production ready
- Make it Open Source
